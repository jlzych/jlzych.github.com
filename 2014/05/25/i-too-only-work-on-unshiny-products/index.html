          <p><a href="https://medium.com/design-founders/847701785dae">Jeff Domke&rsquo;s article</a> about working on &ldquo;unshiny&rdquo; products sums up my view of my own work at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a>. The crux of his argument is that many designers are drawn to working on &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; products — products that are pretty and lauded in the design community — but &ldquo;unshiny&rdquo; products are a lot more interesting to work on. They&rsquo;re often solving difficult problems, and have more room for you to make an impact. You&rsquo;re working to make the product reach its potential. Shiny products, on the other hand, have reached that potential, and you are less able to make your mark.</p>
          
          <p>Optimizely sits right in the sweet spot. We aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; (compared to sexy products like Square and Medium, we have a long way to go); nor are we &ldquo;unshiny&rdquo; (our customers describe us as well-designed and easy-to-use). Rather, we land more in the middle — we have a solid user experience that has a lot of room for improvement.</p>
          
          <p>We&rsquo;re also solving really hairy, complex problems. Apps that get mounds of praise tend to solve relatively simple problems (such as to-do list apps). It&rsquo;s much more interesting to work on a problem space that is unexplored and is full of murky, vague, conflicting goals that must be untangled. And once you&rsquo;ve made sense of the mess, you know you&rsquo;ve enabled someone to do their job better.</p>
          
          <p>And that&rsquo;s the most exciting part of working at Optimizely — making the product fulfill its potential, and solving tough problems that impact businesses&rsquo; bottom lines.</p>
