          <p>In the spirit of <a href="/2015/08/30/get-comfortable-sharing-shitty-work/">sharing my work</a>, I thought it would be fun to look back at some early web sites I designed and built.</p>
          
          <h2 id="first-site-ced-ventura">First site: CED Ventura</h2>
          
          <p>I built this site while I was in high school in 2000 or 2001 for my dad, who manages the Ventura branch of <a href="http://www.cedcareers.com/">CED</a>. It was the first full site I designed and built. I built it as the final project of a web design class I took in high school, and it went live shortly after that (you can still see it on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020123140629/http://www.cedventura.com/">Wayback Machine</a>). Prior to this I had been experimenting with HTML and made some sample sites, but had never made a full site.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="CED Ventura" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/1-ced.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>Fun facts about this project:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>No CSS</strong>. CSS barely existed back then and didn&rsquo;t become practical to use until the mid-2000s. I had never even heard of CSS when I made this site. All styling comes from HTML tags like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code>, images, and some style attributes like <code>valign</code>.</li>
          <li><strong>Frames</strong>. The whole site is built in a <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> â€” one for the top logo area, another for the navigation, and a third for the content. Back then that was the best way to reuse content across pages, since static site generators didn&rsquo;t exist and I didn&rsquo;t know anything about server-side programming at the time.</li>
          <li><strong>Tables for positioning</strong>. Since I knew nothing about CSS back then, and it wasn&rsquo;t a viable option anyway, I used tables to position everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Spacer gifs</strong>! In addition to using tables for positioning, I also sprinkled spacer gifs throughout the site to position elements.</li>
          <li><strong>Hand-coded</strong>. Yep, the whole site was coded by hand, before that became a retro, throwback badge of honor. I seem to recall using Dreamweaver to build the site, but was somehow already experienced enough to know the code it generated was shit, so I primarily lived in the code view.</li>
          <li><strong>Animated gifs</strong>. You can&rsquo;t tell from this static screenshot, but the homepage had not 1, but <strong>2</strong> animated gifs on it: the logo in the top left that says &ldquo;CED Consolidated Electrical Distributors,&rdquo; which fades in one letter at a time over the excruciatingly long period of about 10 seconds (longer than your typical Snapchat); and the map, which features each dot lighting up to emphasize how many locations CED has nationwide. I thought I was <em>the shit</em> for making each of these animated gifs. Once again, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020123140629/http://www.cedventura.com/">Wayback Machine</a> will let you experience these gifs in all their glory.</li>
          <li><strong>1,300px wide top banner</strong>. At the time, a 1,300 pixel wide image for the banner seemed <em>absurdly</em> wide and I didn&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;d ever be a monitor large enough to display it. Boy was I wrong. When viewed on any computer today the image will start to repeat.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 id="the-local-oafs">The Local Oafs</h2>
          
          <p>This is the second full website I designed and built. In true American tradition, I made this site for my closest friends&rsquo; band, The Local Oafs (named after a <a href="https://youtu.be/Lsnc5FFI5Dw?t=454">Simpsons reference</a>, if you were wondering). I&rsquo;m not sure it was ever on the public internet, but if so it was probably hosted on Geocities.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Local Oafs splash page" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/2-oafs1.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>For whatever reason, I added a splash page to the site. I guess that was all the rage back then. I also designed the sweet logo with one of the band members. We also printed up stickers of the logo, and stuck it on a shirt.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Local Oafs homepage" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/2-oafs2.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>Pretty sweet grunge look going on here, which I made in Photoshop. This site also features a table layout, spacer gifs, and no CSS.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Local Oafs bio page" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/2-oafs3.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>I made bio pages for each band member, adding a different rad Photoshop effect to each bio pic. I really hope we were being ironic, but I fear we probably thought this was actually cool. I was also the band&rsquo;s photographer, and did a photoshoot to populate the site with pictures.</p>
          
          <h2 id="anacapa-fine-yarns">Anacapa Fine Yarns</h2>
          
          <p>This is the first site I actually got paid for, which was hugely exciting at the time (2004 or 2005, I believe). I think I got a couple hundred bucks, which felt like highway robbery. I built the site for my parents&rsquo; friend who opened this yarn shop in Ventura.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Anacapa Fine Yarns homepage" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/3-afy.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>Oof those colors. Not sure what I was thinking there. And the nav items are green when hovered ðŸ˜¬. And such centering!</p>
          
          <p>For whatever reason I have two versions of the site on my computer. I think I rebuilt the site for her about a year after the initial version. Unfortunately the design updates I made didn&rsquo;t include a better color palette. The biggest update, however, was that I built the site with CSS. This must have been the first real site that I used CSS on. It features great selectors like <code>div#main</code>.</p>
          
          <p>The properties are surprisingly well organized, though. I grouped them by position, width/height, typography, and finally visual styles (background, border, etc.). The selectors are all quite flat, and I indented them to indicate the nesting in the HTML. Which seems pretty forward thinking considering pre-processors didn&rsquo;t exist yet and I was pretty new to CSS.</p>
          
          <h2 id="hamlet-on-the-moon">Hamlet on the Moon</h2>
          
          <p>In college a close friend of mine did an adaption of Hamlet set on the moon, aptly named &ldquo;Hamlet on the Moon.&rdquo; It was actually a full play that was produced and performed at UCSB. It featured Polonius as a robot named &ldquo;Poloniusbot,&rdquo; Ophelia as a cyborg named &ldquo;Opheliatron,&rdquo; and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as a two-headed monster. I designed and built the website, posters, and program for them.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Hamlet on the Moon homepage" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/4-hamlet-site.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>Can you tell this play takes place on the moon? You may need to look again to pick up on the space theme. I especially love the NASA-y font for the nav, and that I made it a literal block of text by adjusting the type size to maintain a fixed width. And there&rsquo;s virtually no vertical space between them. I had to do the text with images since web fonts were still years away.</p>
          
          <p>And don&rsquo;t miss that great pseudo-drop cap in the first paragraph.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Hamlet on the Moon poster" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/4-hamlet-poster.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>This is one of two posters I created for them, which I believe they actually printed and put up around campus. The oddest thing about the posters is that neither feature dates, times, location, or the website&rsquo;s URL. I have no idea why we chose to only have the email address on the poster.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Hamlet on the Moon program" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/4-hamlet-program.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>The program, on the other hand, does include the date, time, and location, even though you&rsquo;d have to be at the play already to be holding one of these. But overall it actually came out pretty decently. I was taking typography and print layout classes at the time and put those skills to use. It&rsquo;s at least a more understated and mature design than the website.</p>
          
          <h2 id="pixie">Pixie</h2>
          
          <p>Around 2008 or 2009 my close friend (who also did Hamlet on the Moon) started building Pixie, a web-based pixel art editor. I helped out with design and frontend engineering. I also built a couple features, like fill. I believe this was my first exposure to HAML and SASS. Looking back on it, this was the first time I did product design (although I wouldn&rsquo;t have called it that back then).</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Pixie pixel editor" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/5-pixie.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>The design is pretty clean. Probably a little <em>too</em> clean. Those left icons are about to float off the page. And are they even clickable? I kind of like the way the line draws your eye from the top left to bottom right, even though the line itself strangles the page a bit. The left button style and icons are weirdly inconsistent with the top button style and icons. Perhaps I was trying to draw a distinction between image editing tools, like drawing and erasing, and document controls, like &ldquo;Save&rdquo;? And what is that bottom icon supposed to do? The &ldquo;logo&rdquo; is also odd â€“Â where did that orange come from? I still hadn&rsquo;t really figured out &ldquo;color palettes.&rdquo;</p>
          
          <h2 id="cal-cooking-club">Cal Cooking Club</h2>
          
          <p>In 2010 I was in grad school and a member of the Cal Cooking Club, so I made their website. It features web fonts and a clean, modern design! I believe I used this for a class project, too. I think I made a static version of the site first, and then converted it to a Wordpress theme so the officers could update the site themselves.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Cal Cooking Club homepage" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/6-ccc.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>Not the pinnacle of design, but it at least doesn&rsquo;t make me cringe. The oddest thing about the design is that I tried to keep the site on a grid, which is why the nav items have weird spacing between them. I think I had just read <a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2010/11/05/i-wrote-a-book/">Ordering Disorder</a> by Khoi Vinh and went a bit too far trying to put his principles into practice.</p>
          
          <h2 id="privacy-patterns">Privacy Patterns</h2>
          
          <p><a href="http://privacypatterns.org">Privacy Patterns</a> is a project spearheaded by one of my grad school professors and a PhD student, with the goal of documenting best practices for building software that supports privacy. I got involved to help them design and build the site.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Privacy Patterns homepage" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/7-privacy1.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>We built the site using <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a>, a static site generator. All the content was stored in Markdown for ease of authoring and portability. I believe it&rsquo;s the first statically-generated site I built (with the help of a fellow grad student). Surprisingly I didn&rsquo;t use SASS, even though I had at least experimented with it at this point. If I had to guess, it was probably because Hyde is built in Python, and SASS in Ruby.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Privacy Patterns article" src="/images/2016-07-02-a-look-back-at-my-early-web-design-work/7-privacy2.png?1467509653" /></p>
          
          <p>Overall the site isn&rsquo;t too bad. Clean design, no weird colors, and good type hierarchy.</p>
          
          <hr>
          
          <p>It&rsquo;s humbling to look back at where I started and reflect on how far I&rsquo;ve come since. Best practices, technologies, and design trends all shaped my work, and have changed a lot over the years. It will be fascinating to look back at the work I&rsquo;m doing now and marvel at the misguided decisions that seemed so right at the time.</p>
