            <p>This past January I started my new gig at <a href="https://www.gladly.com">Gladly</a>, managing the product design team. Unlike at Optimizely, where I transitioned into managing people I already worked with, at Gladly I inherited a team who didn&rsquo;t know me at all. Inspired by my new boss who did the same thing, I wrote a document to describe what my new team could expect from me as their manager. I decided to re-publish that document here. Enjoy.</p>

            <p>This doc is an accelerator in building our relationship. It will take a little while for us to find our rhythm, but we can try to short-circuit the storming phase and get some things on the table from the get go. I look forward to learning similar things about you â€” at your time.</p>
            
            <p>Some of these bullet points are aspirational. They are standards of behavior that I&rsquo;m trying to hold myself accountable to. If you ever believe I&rsquo;m falling short, please tell me.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>My goal is to provide an environment where you can do your best work.</li>
            <li>I will support and encourage you in doing your best work, not tell you what to do. I want each of you to be autonomous and to make your own decisions. This means you may occasionally make mistakes, which is perfectly fine. I&rsquo;ll be there to help you pick up the pieces.</li>
            <li>In supporting you doing your best work, I will help remove roadblocks that are getting in your way.</li>
            <li>I like to listen and gather context, data, and understanding before making decisions or passing judgement. This means I may ask you a lot of questions to build my knowledge. It also means I will sometimes stay quiet and hold the space for you to keep speaking. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m questioning you, your abilities, or your choices.</li>
            <li>I don&rsquo;t like to waste my time, and I don&rsquo;t want to waste yours. If you ever feel like a meeting, project, etc., isn&rsquo;t a good use of your time, please tell me.</li>
            <li>I take a lot of notes, and write a lot of documents to codify conversations.</li>
            <li>I&rsquo;m biased towards action and shipping over perfection and analysis paralysis. There&rsquo;s no better test of a product or feature than getting it in the hands of real users, then iterating and refining.</li>
            <li>I will try to give you small, frequent feedback (positive and negative) in the moment, when it&rsquo;s fresh, and in person. I don&rsquo;t like batching up feedback for 1:1s or performance reviews, which turns those into dreadful affairs that no one enjoys, and leads to stale, ineffective feedback. If you have a preferred way of receiving feedback, please tell me.</li>
            <li>My goal is to give you more positive feedback than critical feedback. There&rsquo;s always positive feedback to give. And positive feedback helps tell you what you&rsquo;re doing well, and to keep doing it. If you feel like I haven&rsquo;t given you positive feedback recently, please tell me.</li>
            <li>I like feedback to be a 2-way street, so if there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;m doing that you don&rsquo;t like, annoys you, etc., please let me know. If there&rsquo;s things that I&rsquo;m doing well that you want me to keep doing, also let me know! Feel free to pull me aside, or tell me in our 1:1s.</li>
            <li>1:1s are your meetings. You own the agenda. They can be as structured or unstructured as you want. I will occasionally have topics to discuss, but most of the time your items come first.</li>
            <li>You own your career growth. I am there to support and encourage you and to help you find opportunities for growth, but ultimately you&rsquo;re in control of your career.</li>
            <li>I trust you to make good decisions, get your work done, and use your time wisely. I trust you to not abuse our unlimited vacation policy and to take time off when you need it. If you haven&rsquo;t taken any time off in awhile, I&rsquo;ll probably encourage you to take a vacation :) I&rsquo;m not particularly worried about what hours you work, or where you work, as long as you&rsquo;re getting your work done (and aren&rsquo;t working too much).</li>
            <li>Finally, here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://jlzych.com/2018/12/03/my-beliefs-about-design/">list of my beliefs about design</a>.</li>
