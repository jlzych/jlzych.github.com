            <p>After jamming with a friend, she commented that she felt emotionally spent afterwards. Not quite sure what she meant, I asked her to elaborate. She said that improvising music makes you feel vulnerable. You’ve got to put yourself out there, which opens you up to judgement and criticism.</p>
            
            <p>And she’s right. In that moment I realized that being a designer trained me to get over that fear. I know I have to start somewhere shitty before I can get somewhere good. Putting myself and my ideas out there is part of that process. My work only becomes good through feedback and iteration.</p>
            
            <p>So my advice to you, young designer, is to accept the fact that before your work becomes great, it&rsquo;s going to be shitty. This will be hard at first. You&rsquo;ll feel vulnerable. You’ll fear judgement. You’ll worry about losing the respect of your colleagues.</p>
            
            <p><strong>But get over it</strong>. We&rsquo;ve all felt this way before. Just remember that we&rsquo;re all in this together. We all want to produce great work for our customers. We all want to make great music together.</p>
            
            <p>So get comfortable sharing your shitty work. You’ll start off discordant, but through the process of iteration and refinement you’ll eventually hit your groove.</p>
