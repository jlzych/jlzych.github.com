            <p>Having found my guiding concept in my <a href="/2020/01/27/site-redesign-i-the-guiding-concept/">last post</a> (tl;dr is it should feel like me, but on the internet, as expressed through SoCal summer vibes), I started gathering inspiration for how to translate that into colors, fonts, and an overall site design.</p>
            
            <p>Right off the bat I had a couple of shirts and posters in mind that had the exact vibe I wanted. They said &ldquo;California&rdquo; (literally and figuratively), warmth, and summer to me.</p>

            <em>Shirts and posters that immediately inspired me. I own the shirts in the top left.</em></p>
            
            <p>From there, I kept my eyes peeled while browsing Instagram, reading my daily dose of design blogs, and experiencing the world. I screenshotted my favorites and photographed sunsets (specifically the time right when the sun is getting at or below the horizon, which has beautiful oranges, yellows, and a warm blue sky).</p>
            
            <p><a href="/images/2020-redesign/sunset-photos.png"><img alt="Pictures of sunsets that inspired me" src="/images/2020-redesign/sunset-photos.png?1581401423" /></a>
            <em>Pictures of sunsets that inspired me</em></p>
            
            <p>Over the months (I wasn&rsquo;t in a hurry, and this work was mostly passive), I got pulled towards 60s/70s styles, which often have a warm color palette, rounded serifs (like Cooper), and repeating lines and shapes.</p>
            
            <p><a href="/images/2020-redesign/60s-70s.png"><img alt="60s and 70s graphics I was diggin" src="/images/2020-redesign/60s-70s.png?1581401423" /></a>
            <em>60s and 70s graphics I was diggin</em></p>
            
            <p>For the site itself, I was inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/julesforrest/status/1163185120456531968">tweet I saw from Jules Forrest</a> praising the site design of <a href="https://iheanyi.com/">Iheanyi Ekechukwu</a>. I loved the gradient border/background, and the otherwise simple layout with its focus on the content. An image immediately snapped into my head of this layout and gradient, but with my 60s/70s summer color palette.</p>
            
            <p><a href="/images/2020-redesign/iheanyi.jpeg"><img alt="Screenshot of Iheanyi's website" src="/images/2020-redesign/iheanyi.jpeg?1581401424" /></a>
            <em>Screenshot of Iheanyi&rsquo;s website that Jules posted</em></p>
            
            <p>This gave me enough direction to start choosing typography and a color palette for the site, which I&rsquo;ll describe in my next posts. In the meantime, check out my <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/808494599049531462/jlzych.com-site-explorations-2019">Figma file that I published</a> on their community page (which contains spoilers for the actual site design).</p>

            <h1 class='article__title'><a href="/2020/01/27/site-redesign-i-the-guiding-concept/">Site Redesign I: The Guiding Concept</a></h1>
            <p>As some of you may have noticed, I (semi-)recently gave my site a visual overhaul. It&rsquo;s far more opinionated than before, so I want to document my decision making process over the next couple of posts.</p>
            
            <p><a href="/images/2020-redesign/before-after.png"><img alt="Screenshot of my site before and after the redesign" src="/images/2020-redesign/before-after.png?1581401423" /></a>
            <em>Before (left): a dull gray background. Minion typeface throughout. After (right): much warmer. More engaging. More personality.</em></p>
            
            <p>First up is the concept that drove the visual design of the site. The concept took a long time to come into focus, but is the most important (and hardest) part of the redesign.</p>
            
            <p>When I transitioned my site from a portfolio to a blog (circa 2012, after graudating from grad school), there was no concept behind it. I just wanted a site that &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t look bad&rdquo; and was easy to read (it was a <em>blog</em>, remember?). That meant safe, overused typeface (Minion). Minimal color. No ornamentation. Nothing flashy or special at all, really. Just text on a page.</p>
            
            <p>The <em>JZ</em> monogram was just the letters set in a nice font, cut out of a box. I designed it like that because I thought it looked cool. The image came to me one day, so I whipped it up in Illustrator. I chose the blue-kissed green because it looked nice and was neither flashy nor boring. Not exactly the strongest reasoning.</p>
            
            <p>So I ended up with a site that looked fine, and avoided making mistakes, but that was it. It wasn&rsquo;t special or unique or interesting.</p>
            
            <p>And that&rsquo;s how my site was for many years. It did its job. But as the site kept evolving, I wanted the design to be more opinionated and memorable.</p>
            
            <p>That&rsquo;s when I started looking for a stronger point of view to express. A feeling to evoke. A guiding concept to build around.</p>
            
            <p>My starting point was just to make my site feel more personal. It&rsquo;s my site. A blog. Not a corporate site. Not a product page. Not a publication. So I should express myself more. That led me to swap my knocked-out JZ with a hand-lettered monogram a couple of years back. I also added a better photo and a hand-lettered &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; on my about page.</p>
            
            <p><a href="/images/2020-redesign/about-before-after.png"><img alt="Screenshot of my about page before and after the redesign" src="/images/2020-redesign/about-before-after.png?1581401423" /></a>
            <em>Before (left 2): I don&rsquo;t have a screenshot of the original about page, but the leftmost image is an unstyled version of the page from the Wayback Machine, and isn&rsquo;t far off from how it looked. The middle one is a revamped page from some number of years ago. After (right): how it looks at the time of this post. It doesn&rsquo;t fully live up to the new concept, but is the best yet.</em></p>
            
            <p>While these all undoubtedly improved my site, the concept wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to stand on its own two legs.</p>
            
            <p>I pushed myself to go deeper. &ldquo;What does more personal mean? What makes a website &lsquo;personal&rsquo; anyway?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have answers, but they were good provocations to keep in the back of my mind.</p>
            
            <p>While I let those questions marinate (for more than a year, probably — it&rsquo;s hard to remember, exactly), I read <em>Conversational Design</em> by Erika Hall, who recommends thinking of a website (or app, or any touchpoint) as a person as a way to create a memorable design (which I also read about many years ago in <em>Well Designed</em> by Jon Kolko and forgot about). How would that person talk? Act? Dress?</p>
            
            <p>That&rsquo;s when all these disparate ideas — making my site &ldquo;more personal;&rdquo; the website as extension of self; touchpoints as people — fused into one: my site should be an extension of me! When people interact with my site, it should feel like interacting with me IRL (that&rsquo;s <em>in real life</em> for the older crowd).</p>
            
            <p>The concept immediately connected with me. There was just one problem: how do I do that? What does it mean to translate myself into a digital medium? How does a website &ldquo;feel&rdquo; like me? What feelings do people get when they see me, or think of me? How would my friends describe me?</p>
            
            <p>It got very existential very quickly. 😳 Who am I? What defines me? Shorts? T-shirts? Owls? Bravo reality TV?</p>
            
            <p>Once again, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to answer. And once again, I let this idea marinate in the back of my brain.</p>
            
            <p>After many months (at least), I was in the kitchen at work wearing my customary shorts and owl t-shirt, when my coworker reacted with surprise at my outfit (it was winter), and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you always bring summer with you wherever you go!&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>BOOM! 💥 That was the underlying concept I was looking for! Summer, warm, friendly, beach-y, So Cal vibes. Those were feelings I could evoke on the screen with visual design.</p>
            
            <p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll write about how I turned those into the color and font choices you&rsquo;re seeing now (unless you&rsquo;re from the future).</p>

            <h1 class='article__title'><a href="/2020/01/22/books-read-2019/">Books Read 2019</a></h1>
            <p>In 2019 I read 30 books, which is pretty good considering some were huge like <em>The System of the World</em> and <em>The Power Broker</em>. Also, I got married 🤵👰, and it turns out planning takes a ton of time. Other books, though, were glorified picture books, like <em>Palette Perfect</em>, so I guess it all evens out. It&rsquo;s also 7 more books than I <a href="/2019/01/03/books-read-2018/">read last year</a>, and more than double <a href="/2017/12/31/books-read-in-2017/">2017</a>.</p>
            
            <h2 id="favorite-non-fiction">Favorite Non-fiction</h2>
            
            <p><em>The Power Broker</em> by Robert Caro.</p>
            
            <p>Hands down the best non-fiction book I&rsquo;ve read. It took me a long time to work up the courage to start it since it&rsquo;s huge, but boy was it worth it. I was worried it would be dry since it&rsquo;s about the political maneuvering of Robert Moses, the NYC Parks Commissioner (among other titles) who shaped NYC, but Robert Caro is an excellent writer (and even better researcher), so the book has a strong narrative arc that pulls you through the story. He somehow turns a vote on a bill into <em>compelling drama</em>. If you&rsquo;ve been interested in reading this book but are too intimidated to start like I was, then stop whatever you&rsquo;re reading now and start <em>The Power Broker</em>. You won&rsquo;t regret it. I loved it so much I&rsquo;ve started his 5-part Lyndon B. Johnson biography.</p>
            
            <h2 id="favorite-fiction">Favorite Fiction</h2>
            
            <p><em>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</em> by Dave Eggers.</p>
            
            <p>This book is autobiographical and based on real events in Dave Eggers&rsquo; life, but he calls it a work of fiction (and it&rsquo;s generally classified that way by libraries). This book is deeply moving and sad, but worthwhile. And that ending&hellip; oof.</p>
            
            <h2 id="favorite-design-product-book">Favorite Design/Product Book</h2>
            
            <p>Tied between <em>Beauty</em> by Sagmeister and Walsh, and <em>The Designer&rsquo;s Dictionary of Type</em> by Sean Adams.</p>
            
            <p><em>Beauty</em> made the argument that industrial design and architecture of the 20th century was overtaken by Bauhaus and &ldquo;form follows function,&rdquo; at the expense of beauty. In other words, we valued objects and buildings being functional, and devalued beauty as frivolous &ldquo;ornamentation.&rdquo; This book is an argument against this trend. People&rsquo;s lives and society can be improved by having more beauty in it. As a product designer, I got caught up in &ldquo;form follows function&rdquo; and not valuing beauty, and this book pushed me to re-evaluate that (which is part of the reason I visually updated my site recently).</p>
            
            <p><em>The Designer&rsquo;s Dictionary of Type</em> gave me a deeper appreciation of typefaces, more so than any previous type book I&rsquo;ve read. I&rsquo;m not sure why, since this book follows a familiar format of grouping type into different families (serif, blackletter, script, etc.) and giving the history of the most famous typefaces in each category. But it may have been the right book at the right time. I&rsquo;ve been doing hand lettering for the past couple of years, which got me to engage deeply with letters and their shapes and curves and forms, which may have magnified all the minor differences between each font that I had previously overlooked.</p>
            
            <h3 id="biggest-disappointments">Biggest Disappointments</h3>
            
            <p><em>Play Bigger</em>. This talked about a lot of ideas I have seen batted around for awhile (specifically, being a &ldquo;category defining company&rdquo;), so it didn&rsquo;t feel particularly novel. Maybe that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a few years late to it. It also rang hollow because it basically says to create a category for your product, but then pays lip service to the fact that your product <em>actually has to be different enough to be a new category</em>. It also cites Apple and Facebook as examples throughout the book, but they are such wild outliers of success, and so many factors (many out of their control) contributed to their wild success, that citing them as examples is not particularly helpful or compelling evidence for why their ideas are correct or can be replicated. You know, survivor bias and all that.</p>
            
            <p>The other disappointment was <em>The Messy Middle</em>. I didn&rsquo;t disagree with anything in this book, but I also didn&rsquo;t get anything new out of it. I&rsquo;ve seen all these ideas in other books/articles/podcasts. It had a lot of vignettes of ideas about the creative process that weren&rsquo;t particularly deep, and didn&rsquo;t make me see anything in a new way.</p>

            <h1 class='article__title'><a href="/2019/11/23/a-story-about-the-importance-of-designing-every-screen/">A cautionary tale about the importance of designing every screen</a></h1>
            <p>&ldquo;What does the &lsquo;Archived&rsquo; tab look like?&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>I was walking the engineers through the final designs of some admin screens when they asked me this. The page is just a table of objects, with a tab showing the active ones, and another tab showing archived ones.</p>
            
            <p>I hadn&rsquo;t explicitly designed the &ldquo;Archived&rdquo; tab since it was the same basic design as the accompanying active tab – a table. But I told the engineers I would mock it up.</p>
            
            <p>I expected mocking it up to take a few minutes. Boy was I naive! As I mocked it up I discovered a bunch of complexity that I hadn’t anticipated (and the engineers hadn’t anticipated either). What’s the un-archive flow? These objects can be nested inside of each other (like folders), so does un-archiving a parent un-archive all of its descendants? If a child is nested, but the parent is active, how do we display that in the table (on the active tab, children are visually shown underneath and indented from parents, but if the parent isn’t archived the child will be &ldquo;orphaned&rdquo; on the archived tab)? If a parent and its children are archived, can you un-archive just a child? If so, where does it appear in the active hierarchy (it will once again be &ldquo;orphaned&rdquo;)?</p>
            
            <p>I mocked up these flows and made some product and design decisions to address the above complexity based on what the user would expect in these situations, and what I believe is technically possible based on my understanding of how the feature is being built. I shared it with the engineers and luckily they agreed with my decisions, so we had a happy ending (for now, at least — more unforeseen complexity may pop up while they code it).</p>
            
            <p>The lesson here is that you should always <strong>design every screen</strong>, even if you assume it will look the same as another similar screen. Engineers appreciate you being explicit, and in the worst case (or best case, depending on your perspective), you’ll discover open questions that need to be addressed.</p>

            <h1 class='article__title'><a href="/2019/09/13/user-research-interview-tip-shut-up/">User Research Interview Tip: Shut. Up.</a></h1>
            <p>If you were to look at Robert Caro&rsquo;s notebook, you would see lots of &ldquo;SU”s, short for “Shut Up!&rdquo;, scattered throughout his interview notes. The Pulitzer-prize winning author of <em>The Power Broker</em>, among other mammoth books, uses this trick to keep himself silent while interviewing subjects. About this, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/the-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives">he writes</a>:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p>In interviews, silence is the weapon, silence and people’s need to fill it—as long as the person isn’t you, the interviewer. Two of fiction’s greatest interviewers—Georges Simenon’s Inspector Maigret and John le Carré’s George Smiley—have little devices they use to keep themselves from talking and to let silence do its work. Maigret cleans his ever-present pipe, tapping it gently on his desk and then scraping it out until the witness breaks down and talks. Smiley takes off his eyeglasses and polishes them with the thick end of his necktie. As for me, I have less class. When I’m waiting for the person I’m interviewing to break a silence by giving me a piece of information I want, I write “SU” (for Shut Up!) in my notebook. If anyone were ever to look through my notebooks, he would find a lot of “SU”s.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is a fantastic trick to use during user research interviews, too. Remaining silent after a person&rsquo;s initial response often leads them to elaborate more, revealing an additional nuance, or an exception to the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; use case they just described.</p>
            
            <p>I take longhand notes on paper for this reason. My note taking never keeps pace with the speaker, so I&rsquo;m always catching up after they stop talking, which forces me to shut up.</p>
            
            <p>When you&rsquo;re interviewing users, find your own eyeglass polishing or &ldquo;SU.&rdquo;</p>
