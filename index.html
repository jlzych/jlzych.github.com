          <h1><a href="/2014/05/25/i-too-only-work-on-unshiny-products/">I, Too, Only Work On Unshiny Products</a></h1>
          <p><a href="https://medium.com/design-founders/847701785dae">Jeff Domke&rsquo;s article</a> about working on &ldquo;unshiny&rdquo; products sums up my view of my own work at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a>. The crux of his argument is that many designers are drawn to working on &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; products — products that are pretty and lauded in the design community — but &ldquo;unshiny&rdquo; products are a lot more interesting to work on. They&rsquo;re often solving difficult problems, and have more room for you to make an impact. You&rsquo;re working to make the product reach its potential. Shiny products, on the other hand, have reached that potential, and you are less able to make your mark.</p>
          
          <p>Optimizely sits right in the sweet spot. We aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; (compared to sexy products like Square and Medium, we have a long way to go); nor are we &ldquo;unshiny&rdquo; (our customers describe us as well-designed and easy-to-use). Rather, we land more in the middle — we have a solid user experience that has a lot of room for improvement.</p>
          
          <p>We&rsquo;re also solving really hairy, complex problems. Apps that get mounds of praise tend to solve relatively simple problems (such as to-do list apps). It&rsquo;s much more interesting to work on a problem space that is unexplored and is full of murky, vague, conflicting goals that must be untangled. And once you&rsquo;ve made sense of the mess, you know you&rsquo;ve enabled someone to do their job better.</p>
          
          <p>And that&rsquo;s the most exciting part of working at Optimizely — making the product fulfill its potential, and solving tough problems that impact businesses&#39; bottom lines.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2014/05/19/on-being-a-generalist/">On Being a Generalist</a></h1>
          <p>I recently read <a href="http://frankchimero.com/intros/quilt/">Frank Chimero</a>&rsquo;s excellent article, <a href="http://frankchimero.com/talks/designing-in-the-borderlands/transcript/">&ldquo;Designing in the Borderlands&rdquo;</a>. The gist of it is that we (designers, and the larger tech community) have constructed walls between various disciplines that we see as opposites, such as print vs. digital, text vs. image, and so on. However, the most interesting design happens in the borderlands, where these different media connect. He cites examples that combine physical and digital media, but the most interesting bit for me was his thoughts on roles that span disciplines:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>For a long time, I perceived my practice’s sprawl as a defect—evidence of an itchy mind or a fear of commitment—but I am starting to learn that a disadvantage can turn into an advantage with a change of venue. The ability to cross borders is an asset. Who else could go from group to group and be welcomed? The pattern happens over and over: if you’re not a part of any group, you can move amongst them all by tip-toeing across the lines that connect them.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I have felt this way many times throughout my career (especially that &ldquo;fear of commitment&rdquo; part). I have long felt like a generalist who works in both design and engineering, and I label myself to help people understand what I do (not to mention the necessity of a title). But I&rsquo;ve never cleanly fit into any discipline.</p>
          
          <p>This line was further blurred by my graduate degree from UC Berkeley&rsquo;s <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">School of Information</a>. The program brings together folks with diverse backgrounds, and produces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills">T-shaped people</a> who can think across disciplines and understand the broader context of their work, whether it be in engineering, design, policy &amp; law, sociology, or dozens of other fields in which our alumni call home.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>These borderlands are the best place for a designer like me, and maybe like you, because the borderlands are where things connect. If you’re in the borderlands, your different tongues, your scattered thoughts, your lack of identification with a group, and all the things that used to be thought of as drawbacks in a specialist enclave become the hardened armor of a shrewd generalist in the borderlands.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Couldn&rsquo;t have said it any better. Being able to move between groups and think across disciplines is more of an advantage than a disadvantage.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2014/05/11/why-we-hire-ui-engineers-on-the-design-team/">Why We Hire UI Engineers on the Design Team</a></h1>
          <p>This <a href="http://cognition.happycog.com/article/why-developers-need-to-learn-design">Happy Cog article</a> by <a href="http://stephencaver.com/">Stephen Caver</a> perfectly encapsulates why we hire <a href="http://jobsco.re/1oHhZGz">UI Engineers</a> on the design team at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> (as opposed to the engineering team). We want the folks coding a UI to be involved in the design process from the beginning, to understand the design system that underlies a user experience, and to be empowered to make design decisions while developing a UI. Successful designs must adapt to various contexts and degrade gracefully. The people most qualified to make those kinds of decisions are the ones writing the code. As said in the article, &ldquo;In this new world, the best thing a developer can do is to acquire an eye for design—to be able to take design aesthetic, realize its essential components, and reinterpret them on the fly.&rdquo; By embracing this mindset in our hiring and design process, we&rsquo;ve found the end result is a higher quality product.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2014/05/03/matthew-carters-my-life-in-typefaces/">Matthew Carter&#8217;s &ldquo;My Life in Typefaces&rdquo;</a></h1>
          <p>I just got around to watching Matthew Carter&rsquo;s excellent TED talk, <a href="http://on.ted.com/sqLe">&ldquo;My Life in Typefaces&rdquo;</a>. In it, he talks about his experience designing type for the past 5 decades, and how technical constraints influenced his designs. The central question he tries to answer is, &ldquo;Does a constraint force a compromise? By accepting a constraint, are you working to a lower standard?&rdquo; This is a question that comes up in every discipline, and with every technological change. Matthew Carter&rsquo;s take on this subject is interesting because he&rsquo;s experienced numerous technological changes, and has designed superb typefaces for all of them.</p>
          
          <p>At first blush, it&rsquo;s easy to conclude that constraints force designers to compromise their vision. But design isn&rsquo;t produced in a vacuum, and ultimately must be realized through one or more mediums (print, screen, radio, etc.). Therefore, one must work within constraints to produce the best designs. To do so, designers must understand the technology that enables their designs to be experienced, be it code, the printing process, and so on. As Matthew Carter said in this talk, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pragmatist, not an idealist, out of necessity,&rdquo; which is a valuable lesson that all designers should take to heart.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2014/04/16/designing-with-instinct-vs-data/">Designing with instinct vs. data</a></h1>
          <p><a href="http://www.gv.com/team/braden-kowitz">Braden Kowitz</a> wrote a <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/design-instinct-vs-data">great article</a> exploring the ever increasing tension between making design decisions based on instinct versus data. As he says, &ldquo;It’s common to think of data and instincts as being opposing forces in design decisions.&rdquo; This is especially true at an <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">A/B testing company</a> — we have a tendency to quantify and measure everything.</p>
          
          <p>He goes on to say, &ldquo;In reality, there’s a blurry line between the two,&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. When I&rsquo;m designing, I&rsquo;m in the habit of always asking, &ldquo;What data would help me make this decision?&rdquo; Sometimes it&rsquo;s usage logs, sometimes it&rsquo;s user testing, sometimes it&rsquo;s market research, and sometimes there isn&rsquo;t anything but my own intuition. Even when there is data, it&rsquo;s all just input I use to help me reach a decision. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to blindly follow data, but it&rsquo;s equally bad to only use your gut. As Braden said, it&rsquo;s important to balance the two.</p>
