          <p>This year I read 14 books, which is 8 fewer than the 22 I read last year (<a href="/2017/01/03/books-i-read-in-2016/">view last year&rsquo;s list here</a>). Lower than I was hoping, but it at least averages out to more than 1 per month. I&rsquo;m not too surprised, though, since I traveled a lot and was busier socially this year. Once again, I was heavy on the non-fiction — I only read 2 fiction books this year. Just 2! I need to up that number in 2018.</p>

          <p><em>by Andy Polaine, Lavrans Løvlie, and Ben Reason</em></p>
          
          <p>This book really opened my eyes to the world of service design and thinking about a person&rsquo;s experience beyond just the confines of the screen. Using the product is just one part of a person&rsquo;s overall experience accomplishing their goal. This book is a great primer on the subject.</p>

          <p><em>by Charles Haxthausen, Christianna Bonin, and Erica Dibenedetto</em></p>
          
          <p>I&rsquo;ve been quite taken by Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s work after seeing his art at various museums, such as the SF MOMA. I finally bought a book to learn more about his work and approach to art. This inspired me to <a href="http://codepen.io/jlzych/full/rjVoby/">re-create his work programmatically</a>.</p>

          <p><em>by Jonathan Franzen</em></p>
          
          <p>This is the first Franzen book I&rsquo;ve read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I&rsquo;ve been interested in him for a long time because David Foster Wallace is a fan of his. A well-written, engaging tale of a family&rsquo;s troubles, anxieties, and the &ldquo;corrections&rdquo; they need to make to keep their lives intact.</p>

          <p>Great book on managing people. Highly recommended for anyone who manages or is interested in managing. Even if you&rsquo;re an individual contributor it&rsquo;s worth reading because it will help you be a better employee and have a better relationship with your boss.</p>

          <p><em>by Don Norman</em></p>
          
          <p>This companion to Norman&rsquo;s <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> is just as good as its better-known sibling. In this book he focuses on the <em>emotional</em> and <em>aesthetic</em> side of design, and why those elements are an important part of designing a successful product. He goes beyond fluffy, surface-level explanations, though, and explains the <em>why</em> behind these phenomenon using science, psychology, and biology. This makes for a convincing argument behind the importance of this aspect of design, which can often be written off as &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo; or self-indulgent.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2017/11/26/my-talk-at-lean-kanban-central-europe-2017/">My Talk at Lean Kanban Central Europe 2017</a></h1>
          <h2 class='article__subtitle'>From 20/20 Hindsight to ESP at Optimizely</h2>
          <p>On a chilly fall day a few weeks back, I gave a talk at the cozy <a href="http://www.leankanbance.com/">Lean Kanban Central Europe</a> in Hamburg, Germany. I was honored to be invited to give a reprise of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Ns5bdg0oo&amp;list=PLVsUnwOzPqiSz8D0WYoUkKxZzzbmM0pPY&amp;index=14">talk I gave with Keith</a> earlier this year at Lean Kanban North America.</p>
          
          <p>I spoke about Optimizely&rsquo;s software development process, and how we&rsquo;ve used ideas from Lean Kanban and ESP (Enterprise Service Planning) to help us ship faster, with higher quality, to better meet customer needs. Overall it went well, but I had too much content and rushed at the end. If I do this talk again, I would cut some slides and make the presentation more focused and concise. Watch the talk below.</p>

          <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
          
          <p>One of the cool things this conference does is give the audience green, yellow, and red index cards they can use to give feedback to the speakers. Green indicates you liked the talk, red means you didn&rsquo;t like it, and yellow is neutral.</p>
          
          <p>I got just one red card, with the comment, &ldquo;topic title not accurate (this is not ESP?!).&rdquo; In retrospect, I realized this person is correct — my talk really doesn&rsquo;t talk about ESP much. I touch on it, but that was what Keith covered. Since he dropped out, I mostly cut those sections of the presentation since I can&rsquo;t speak as confidently about them. If I did this talk solo again, I would probably change the title. So thank you, anonymous commenter 🙏</p>
          
          <p>I also got two positive comments on green cards:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Thanks for sharing. Some useful insights + good to see it used in industry. - Thanks.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>And:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Thank you! Great examples, (maybe less slides next time?) but this was inspiring</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I also got some good tweets, like <a href="https://twitter.com/ofinker/status/928256477667708928">this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/leankanbance/status/928252318566535169">this</a>.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2017/10/29/my-progress-with-hand-lettering/">My Progress with Hand Lettering</a></h1>
          <p>I started hand lettering about a year and half ago, and I thought it would be fun to see the progress I&rsquo;ve made by comparing my early, crappy work to my recent work. I started hand lettering because a coworker of mine is a great letterer and I was inspired by the drawings he would make. I tried a few of his pens and found that trying to recreate the words he drew forced me to focus on the shape of the letter and the movement of the pen, which was intoxicating and meditative. So I bought a few pens and started practicing. Here&rsquo;s the progress I&rsquo;ve made so far.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2017/06/14/how-to-say-no-to-your-ceo-without-saying-no/">How to Say No to Your CEO Without Saying No</a></h1>
          <p>Shortly after I rolled out <a href="/2016/07/17/discovery-kanban-at-optimizely/">Optimizely&rsquo;s Discovery kanban process</a> last year, one of its benefits became immediately obvious: using it as a tool to say No.</p>
          
          <p>This is best illustrated with a story. One day, I was at my desk, minding my own business 🙃, when our CEO came up to me and asked, &ldquo;Hey, is there a designer who could work on &lt;insert special CEO pet project&gt;?&rdquo; In my head, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t a priority. Telling him that directly, though, would have led to us arguing over why we <em>thought</em> the project was or was not important,
          without grounding the argument in the reality of whether it was higher priority than current work-in-progress. And since he&rsquo;s the CEO, I would have lost that argument.</p>
          
          <p>So instead of doing that, I took him to our Discovery kanban board and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s review what each person is doing and see if there&rsquo;s anything we should stop doing to work on your project.&rdquo; I pointed to each card on the board and said why we were doing it: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing this to reach company goal X&hellip; that&rsquo;s important for customer Y,&rdquo; and so on.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="&quot;Optimizely's Discovery kanban board in action&quot;" src="/images/2017-06-14-how-to-say-no-to-your-ceo-without-saying-no/kanban-board.jpg?1497508226" />
          <em>Optimizely&rsquo;s Discovery kanban board in action</em></p>
          
          <p>When we got to the end of the board, he admitted, &ldquo;Yeah, those are all the right things to be doing,&rdquo; and walked away. I never heard about the project again. And just like that, I said No to our CEO without saying No.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2017/02/08/artists-don-t-distinguish-between/">Artists don't distinguish between...</a></h1>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Artists don&rsquo;t distinguish between the act of making something and the act of thinking about it — thinking and making evolve together in an emergent, concurrent fashion. As a result, when approaching a project, an artist often doesn&rsquo;t seem to plan it out. She just goes ahead and begins, all the while collecting data that inform how she will continue. A large part of what drives her confidence to move forward is her faith in her ability to course correct and improvise as she goes.</p>

          <p><em>— John Maeda, &ldquo;Redesigning Leadership&rdquo;</em></p>
          
          <p>This quote from John Maeda&rsquo;s book, <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/redesigning-leadership">Redesigning Leadership</a></em> really resonated with me. It captures my approach to problems and new challenges perfectly. I don&rsquo;t stress too much about having every step planned out — I&rsquo;ve learned to trust my intuition and follow new paths as they appear, having faith that they will lead me to a successful outcome.</p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;Improvise as she goes.&rdquo; I never would have thought of it like that, but &ldquo;improvising&rdquo; is a great way to describe my approach.</p>
