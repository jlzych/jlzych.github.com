          <h1><a href="/2013/10/13/fostering-creative-environments/">Fostering creative environments</a></h1>
          <p>I recently read <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine&rsquo;s</a> article <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/28/on-creative-leadership/">&ldquo;On Creative Leadership&rdquo;</a> that talks about creating an environment in which people can be creative. This section really resonated with me because it&rsquo;s something we do occasionally at Optimizely, and talk about doing more of:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Every month, my team and I enter our planning room for at least three hours. We lock the doors, opening it only for pizza and beer deliveries. Our mission is to solve one problem. In past sessions, we have redesigned the user interface that powers our systems, solved marketing problems by “remarketing,” and found new and creative ways to present information. The role of an impresario has had such a direct and positive impact on the way we do business that I am now introducing the role to every team in our 100+ person company.</p>
          
          <p>Why does having an impresario work? Well, certain rules guide the team to moments of insight:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Identify a very specific problem to solve, and stay focused.</li>
          <li>Provide the necessary tools to spark inspiration (white boards, markers, paper, etc.).</li>
          <li>Be technology-agnostic! Don’t worry about how you will solve the problem; focus only on the why.</li>
          <li>There are no wrong answers; some are just better than others.</li>
          <li>Celebrate failures.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>My team looks forward to their time spent locked up together because it gives us an opportunity to be creative in front of each other. Support their ideas, and help them grow. Don’t force your opinions and thoughts. If the group is moving in the wrong direction, ask them questions until they find the right path.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The design team at Optimizely has done this a few times, and it&rsquo;s always been extremely rewarding and productive. For example, recently another designer and myself locked ourselves in a room all day to redesign our jobs page. By the end of the day, the page was almost fully coded.</p>
          
          <p>This setting allowed us to be productive for two key reasons. First, we were insulated from distractions, which can quickly kill productivity and focus. Second, we had instant, high-bandwidth communication that enabled quick feedback and input from each other when needed. No waiting around for emails or responses via IM.</p>
          
          <p>Given the success of this and other similar sessions, we intend to do more of these focused work sessions in the future to foster our creativity and productivity.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/10/08/extend-sass-s-awkward-stepchild/">Extend - SASS's Awkward Stepchild</a></h1>
          <p>SASS has a lot of really powerful features to help you write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#x27;t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> code quickly. One such feature is <code>@extend</code>, which I find is overlooked by many developers but can be very useful when used properly.</p>
          
          <h2>@-what?</h2>
          
          <p>First, a little background on <code>@extend</code>. It allows a selector to <em>extend</em> the styles of another selector, essentially providing a form of sub-classing. <code>@extend</code> works by combining selectors into a single comma-separated selector. A simple example:</p>
          <pre class="highlight scss"><span class="nc">.button</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mh">#bada55</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1em</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="nc">.button-small</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">@extend</span> <span class="nc">.button</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="mi">.8em</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span></pre>
          <p>Which outputs:</p>
          <pre class="highlight css"><span class="nc">.button</span><span class="o">,</span>&#x000A;<span class="nc">.button-small</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#bada55</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1em</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="nc">.button-small</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0.8em</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span></pre>
          <p>The <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend">SASS docs</a> give a fuller explanation of how it works, and its limitations.</p>
          
          <h2>Why it&rsquo;s great</h2>
          
          <p><code>@extend</code> can cut down duplicate styles and selectors. Modules derived from a base style can all <code>@extend</code> the parent, and all the sub-classes will be added to the base selector. Alternative ways to achieve this in SASS include using mixins to output the base styles (which just adds bloat to the stylesheet, since the same set of rules is output multiple places in the final CSS); duplicate the properties in each selector (violates the principle of DRY and is a maintenance nightmare); or manually add each new selector to the base selector (also violates DRY and also is a maintenance nightmare, and the exact problem <code>@extend</code> was designed to solve).</p>
          
          <h3>Placeholder selectors</h3>
          
          <p>Placeholder selectors make <code>@extend</code> even sweeter. They are selectors that aren&rsquo;t output unless extended by another selector (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type">abstract classes</a> in OOP). It doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but I often run into situations where I have some classes (or elements) that share common styles, but I don&rsquo;t need the base class in the HTML or CSS. For example:</p>
          <pre class="highlight scss"><span class="nc">.container-blue</span><span class="o">,</span>&#x000A;<span class="nc">.container-red</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">padding</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">3em</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">100%</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="nc">.container-blue</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">blue</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="nc">.container-red</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span></pre>
          <p>Each container selector has to be typed out twice &ndash; once for their shared styles, and again for their specific styles. Not a big deal here, but quickly becomes unweildy the more sub-containers you add. Placeholder selectors can help us here:</p>
          <pre class="highlight scss"><span class="nv">%container-common-styles</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">padding</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">3em</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">100%</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="nc">.container-blue</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">@extend</span> <span class="nv">%container-common-styles</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">blue</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="nc">.container-red</span> <span class="p">{</span>&#x000A;  <span class="k">@extend</span> <span class="nv">%container-common-styles</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>&#x000A;<span class="p">}</span></pre>
          <p>Now the common styles are in one place, and each class is in one place. This pays off the more selectors you have extending the placeholder.</p>
          
          <p>You can also feel guilt-free about using unsemantic, descriptive names, since the placeholder itself isn&rsquo;t output in the final CSS. They are purely for yourself and other developers.</p>
          
          <h2>Dangers of @extend</h2>
          
          <p>As with any SASS you write, you need to keep an eye on the final CSS it outputs. If you <code>@extend</code> a class that&rsquo;s used in many places, the selector will be copied to every instance of that class (even if it&rsquo;s nested in other selectors). This is often unnecessary, and can cause unintended side effects (I ran into a nasty styling bug because of this once).</p>
          
          <p>For example, a <code>.button</code> class is originally defined in one place, but modified to look slightly different in a dialog. When extending it, you only wanted the original styles, but the new selector is copied into the dialog button as well. This wasn&rsquo;t what you intended, isn&rsquo;t necessary, and bloated your final CSS. Before extending classes, check everywhere they&rsquo;re defined and make sure you want your selector to be duplicated in all of those places. (Arguably, this is bad CSS to begin with [you shouldn&rsquo;t change a button style based on the dialog context in the first place], but in real world CSS it happens).</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, the depth and breadth of selectors you have nested under the base selector, combined with the number of selectors extending the base, can create some <em>very</em> long selectors, not all of which are necessary. Once again, pay attention to the CSS that&rsquo;s being compiled. And once again, this is arguably bad SASS (mind the <a href="http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule">Inception Rule</a>), but these things happen in legacy codebases with multiple developers.</p>
          
          <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
          
          <p>Extending selectors can save you time and DRY out your code, when used properly. As with most SASS features, it can be abused and create some pretty hairy CSS, but as long as you keep an eye on the final CSS you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/09/30/framing-your-message-for-maximum-impact/">Framing your message for maximum impact</a></h1>
          <p>A common piece of advice in the website optimization space is to test headlines and copy to find the optimal messaging. But there are endless possibilities and it’s not feasible to test them all, so how do you focus your tests on only the content that’s most likely to have an impact? Having a good hypothesis of why a change will be effective is key, and one such theory is <strong>framing</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>Framing is the simple idea that <strong>different ways of presenting the same information will evoke different emotional responses</strong>, and thus influence a person’s decision. A simple example is the statement, &ldquo;the odds of survival one month after surgery are 90%&rdquo; is more reassuring than the equivalent statement of, &ldquo;mortality within one month of surgery is 10%.&rdquo; Although these statements present the same information, they bring drastically different associations to mind. With the former it’s easy to envision an outcome of survival (and thus be willing to go through with the surgery), whereas the latter evokes death (and will be less likely to take the perceived risk).</p>
          
          <p>The subtleties of framing a message are well known to marketers. For example, <a href="http://www.citycliq.com/">CityCliq</a> saw an <a href="http://www.abtests.com/test/284001/landing-for-citycliq">89% conversion increase</a> by changing their headline from, &ldquo;Businesses grow faster online!&rdquo; to, &ldquo;Create a webpage for your business.&rdquo; (They have since further optimized their homepage to have a different headline). The original headline is abstract and framed passively, whereas the winning variation is framed in an action-oriented way.</p>
          
          <p>This idea can be used more widely than for just selling products &mdash; any organization that’s trying to spur people to action can make use of it as well. Convincing people to volunteer for a cause, sign a petition, donate money, etc., can all be greatly influenced by the way the message is framed. For example, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7789354">Banks, et al.</a>, studied how this phenomenon affects behavior by showing two groups of women videos on breast cancer and mammography in order to convince them to get screened. The first group&rsquo;s video was gain-framed, espousing the benefits of having a mammogram, whereas the second group&rsquo;s video was loss-framed and emphasized the risks of not having one. Only 51.5% of those who saw the gain-framed video got a mammography, compared to 61.2% of the latter group (an 18% increase). The information presented was equivalent, but receiving it in a loss-framed context forced people to imagine the scenario of having breast cancer, which spurred them to action.</p>
          
          <p>So how do you know which way to frame your message? There are no one-size-fits-all rules &mdash; it’s still important to test variations. But now instead of arbitrarily changing words (which could go on ad infinitum) you have a narrower and more focused approach to crafting messages. What you want to avoid is testing essentially equivalent phrases that are unlikely to have any significant impact on your goals. For example, the phrases, &ldquo;the odds of survival one month after surgery are 90%&rdquo; and, &ldquo;there is a 90% chance you will be alive a month after surgery&rdquo; contain the same information and are framed equivalently, and thus aren’t likely to change your visitors’ behavior. Instead, <strong>you should think about strikingly different ways you can frame your value proposition</strong> and test each of them. Try asking yourself:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Is this positive or negative (e.g. the odds of survival example)?</li>
          <li>Is this loss-framed or gain-framed (e.g. the mammography study)?</li>
          <li>Is this action-oriented or passive (e.g. the CityCliq create a web page example)?</li>
          <li>More generally, what associations are brought to mind? For example, deli meats that advertise &ldquo;95% fat free&rdquo; sounds healthy, whereas &ldquo;Only 5% fat&rdquo; sounds unhealthy. This is tricky to ascertain a priori, but you can read messages to people around you (co-workers, friends, family) and ask what first comes to mind when they hear it.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Your message may not have a clear answer for all of these, but for the pertinent questions you should <strong>test messages with the opposite framing</strong>. More likely than not, one of them will resonate better with your audience.</p>
          
          <p><em>For more on this topic, read chapter 7 of Daniel Kahneman’s book, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/">Thinking, Fast and Slow.</a>&rdquo;</em></p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/09/22/using-gradients-in-place-of-images/">Using Gradients In Place of Images</a></h1>
          <p>Recently at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a>, I needed to create ribbons as part of the design of our <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/ecommerce-ab-testing">Summertime Christmas</a> campaign (see image below). The easy way would have been to throw a repeating background image on some <code>div</code>s, but then I remembered CSS3 gradients can be used to create some pretty interesting patterns (for example, see <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/">CSS3 patterns gallery</a>). Besides being a novel use of gradients, it also makes my markup more semantic (no empty container <code>div</code>s required), and makes the design more flexible (everything is generated programmatically, and thus easily changeable, unlike images).</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Summertime Christmas campaign with ribbon background" src="http://jlzych.com/images/2013-09-22-using-gradients-in-place-of-images/summertime-xmas.png" /></p>
          
          <p><em>The ribbons of Summertime Christmas</em></p>
          
          <h2>The Technique</h2>
          
          <p>The basic technique is to make the color stops end and start at the same place, thus creating hard lines between colors. Then, set the <code>background-size</code> so the ribbon occupies a specific width instead of spreading across the entire element.</p>
          
          <p>Here&rsquo;s the code for the vertical ribbon (vendor-specific properties left out deliberately):</p>

          <p>Using percentages for the color stops (instead of hard-coded pixel values) allowed me to adjust the width of the ribbon by changing just one number — the first parameter of the <code>background-size</code>. (One thing to be careful of is that the ribbon can render imprecisely in certain browsers when the width gets small, so you may need to use pixel values in these situations.)</p>
          
          <p>To add the horizontal ribbon, it&rsquo;s a simple matter of layering multiple <code>background-image</code>s on top of each other (by providing a comma-separated list of values, the first of which is on top), and switching the vertical and horizontal values of the <code>background-size</code>.</p>

          <h2>Some SCSS to Save Us</h2>
          
          <p>You&rsquo;ve probably noticed there are a lot of repeated values within each <code>linear-gradient</code>. You also probably noticed that the vertical and horizontal ribbons use the same <code>linear-gradient</code>, except for the direction they&rsquo;re rendered (the first parameter). As I was developing this, it quickly became cumbersome to fiddle with the ribbon&rsquo;s sizing and color, so I leveraged SCSS to help me out. I&rsquo;m not going to explain everything that&rsquo;s going on here, but am providing this code for anyone who finds it useful (and for my own future reference).</p>

          <p>Ah, so much cleaner and compact! And it puts every value in one place, making it easy to tweak any aspect of the ribbon.</p>
          
          <h2>One More Example</h2>
          
          <p>I also recently used this technique on the <a href="http://styleguide.optimizely.com">Optimizely styleguide</a> to create the light blue stripe in our navigation, instead of creating a background image or using multiple elements.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Optimizely styleguide navigation" src="http://jlzych.com/images/2013-09-22-using-gradients-in-place-of-images/styleguide-nav.png" /></p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          
          <p>This technique is handy for avoiding image creation, which improves page performance (by avoiding HTTP requests and reducing bandwidth usage), and makes the design easier to modify (no need to fire up Photoshop to make changes!). This example is just scratching the surface of novel ways gradients can be used to draw images in the browser.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/09/09/the-importance-of-good-defaults/">The Importance of Good Defaults</a></h1>
          <p>One of the simplest and most robust findings from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics">behavioral economics</a> is that when people are faced with a choice they tend to stick with the default option. This sounds like something that shouldn’t have any effect on people. Common sense leads us to believe we&rsquo;ll always choose whichever option benefits us the most, regardless of the default. Although this intuitively makes sense, numerous studies show that&rsquo;s not the case. For example, most countries have an option for people to donate their organs upon their death. In America, the default choice is to not donate organs, meaning they must specifically check a box on a form (an &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; system). As a result, the consent rate is only about 28%. In contrast, Belgium’s default option is to donate organs (an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; system), in which about 98% of the population consent to donation (<a href="http://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/DefaultsScience.pdf">read the fully study here [pdf]</a>).</p>
          
          <p>There are many explanations for this behavior. One reason is that making a choice takes effort (even if it’s only checking a box), whereas sticking with the default is effortless. Another reason is when decisions have unclear costs and benefits that are difficult to evaluate (such as organ donation), defaults can imply the &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; option, thus saving people the time of thinking through the choice themselves. It also sends the signal that this is the option most people choose and is a safe bet (which reinforces the idea of <a href="http://jlzych.com/2013/08/02/everyones-reading-this-increase-conversions-with-social-proof/">social proof</a>).</p>
          
          <h2>Applications to Web Design</h2>
          
          <p>Applying this insight to web pages is fairly straightforward: when presenting people with a choice, provide a default option. The simplest method is to pre-populate form fields with the most common choice. For example, the checkout form of an ecommerce store whose customers are mainly American should have &ldquo;United States&rdquo; already chosen as the default country. Obviously, there may be customers from other countries, but they would have to select an option were it left blank anyway. This decreases friction when completing a form, decreases errors, and <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/">increases usability</a>.</p>
          
          <p>The previous scenario is useful, but unlikely to increase conversions significantly. Defaults really shine when people are faced with a less clear-cut choice. For example, if you have multiple service plans, highlighting one will guide people to that option. Deciding which option to make the default is something you should A/B test, but a good approach is to use existing customer data to preselect the most popular option. For example, if you have multiple pricing tiers, you could highlight the most common one.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="No default plan highlighted" src="http://jlzych.com/images/2013-09-09-the-importance-of-good-defaults/no-default.png" /></p>
          
          <p><em>No recommended plan</em></p>
          
          <p><img alt="The most popular plan is highlighted" src="http://jlzych.com/images/2013-09-09-the-importance-of-good-defaults/default.png" /></p>
          
          <p><em>The most popular &ldquo;Plus&rdquo; plan is highlighted</em></p>
          
          <p>Another strategy is to select the option you want your potential customers to select (such as the one that earns you the most profit). This will subtly nudge potential customers towards this option. For example, <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> ran an experiment recommending their Gold plan and saw a 20% increase in signups to that option.</p>
          
          <p>Recommending pricing plans is just one way that default options can be applied to web design. Consider experimenting with your forms, account settings, preferences, or anywhere else people face a choice. By providing a default option to fall back on, you&rsquo;re doing a favor for your customers and yourself.</p>
