    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Creativity is a muscle that we all have. It can be strengthened. It can be practiced. It&amp;rsquo;s not an inherent trait that only a chosen few are anointed with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe this, but it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the central themes of &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2SHc23t"&gt;Walter Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s biography of Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;. In the book he highlights Leonardo&amp;rsquo;s ordinary human habits that anyone can adopt to be more creative. I wrote them down as a reminder to myself, and to help others be more creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci" src="/images/2020-05-leo/leo.jpg?1588724875" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-lessons"&gt;The Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be observant&lt;/strong&gt;. Look closely at every detail. Like, really closely. Uncomfortably closely. Marvel in the beauty and complexity of the world. As Leonardo put it: &amp;ldquo;If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be curious&lt;/strong&gt;. Why is the sky blue? How does a hummingbird&amp;rsquo;s tongue work? What makes people yawn? These are common occurrences that most people don&amp;rsquo;t give a second thought, but Leonardo did. He followed pursuits of inquiry like these not because he thought they had any practical use, but purely out of curiosity. Some of these never led anywhere (like studying the tongue of hummingbirds), while others influenced his work in suprising yet profound ways (like anatomy and Mona Lisa&amp;rsquo;s smile).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abandon paths that aren&amp;rsquo;t working&lt;/strong&gt;. Leonardo left a wake of unfinished work behind him. He often began projects, but gave them up or changed direction when the path he chose was a dead end. Sometimes he would return to a piece after years of not touching it (he worked on the &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt; until the end of his life, and is technically &amp;ldquo;unfinished&amp;rdquo;). This practice gave Leonardo the space to pursue multiple creative endeavors at once, and to let ideas marinate until they were ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re stuck, take a break&lt;/strong&gt;. Leonardo was known to stare at a painting for hours, make one small brush stroke, and leave. Then he may return the next day, week, or year to keep working. What he was doing was focusing deeply on a problem, then leaving to focus his conscious mind elsewhere so that his unconscious mind could take over. The unconscious mind organizes information, makes connections to other parts of your brain, then serves it back to your conscious mind when it&amp;rsquo;s done. This is why you often need to &amp;ldquo;sleep on it,&amp;rdquo; or have your best ideas in the shower. (I like to wash dishes as a way of quickly stepping away from a problem). As Leonardo put it: &amp;ldquo;Men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work least, for their minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their conceptions, to which they afterwards give form.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for patterns and make analogies&lt;/strong&gt;. When Leonardo observed rivers branching and splitting into tributaries and offshoots, he saw the same pattern in the trunk of a tree splitting into branches, which he also saw in the arteries of humans. Comparisons like these led to breakthroughs in Leonardo&amp;rsquo;s work across science, engineering, architecture, art, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace mystery, the unexpected, the unknowable&lt;/strong&gt;. This leads to happy accidents, unexpected connections, and surprising breakthroughs that look like genius to others, but to you feel like obvious connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how these all work in tandem and build on each other. Being observant and curious gives you multiple areas of interest to pursue at once, which gives you topics to switch between when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck, which fills your brain with more knowledge, which gives your mind more connections to make, leading to creative breakthroughs and new mysteries to observe and be curious about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was Leonardo a singular genius? Absolutely. Could anyone become the next Leonardo with enough practice? Sadly not. But Leonardo was still human, and we can all bring out our inner Leonardos by embracing the ordinary, human techniques that Leonardo used throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2yU0mTQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interaction of Color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is, by far, the best book on color I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. Other teaching methods focus on theory, color systems, the physics of color (wavelength, rods and cones, etc.), or resort to rote rules like, &amp;ldquo;red means danger.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s mechanical, mathematical, rules-based, and divorced from how people perceive and react to color. Or as Albers puts it: &amp;ldquo;Experience teaches that in visual perception there is a discrepancy between physical fact and psychic effect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Albers&amp;rsquo; teaches you how to truly &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; color. His central thesis is that there are no absolutes in color. The way humans perceive color is influenced by the surrounding context of neighboring colors, lighting conditions, size and quantity, what we look at before and after, and more. Two colors can look like one. One color can look like two. What looks dull in one context may look bright in another. Reds can look cool-toned, and blues can be warm-toned. As Albers says, &amp;ldquo;This fact makes color the most relative medium in art.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He teaches you to see this relativity of color through a series of exercises. To get the most out of the book, you need to do the exercises, and often many times to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting the desired effect. As a result, it took me at least 4 years, off and on, to get through it all (you could do it in a couple of months if you were diligent, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m done, I thought it would be fun to share the output of those exercises, both for posterity and the benefit of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning&lt;/em&gt;: This post ended up being longer than I was expecting, so feel free to just skim through the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-exercises"&gt;The Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exercises&amp;rsquo; aim is to show a particular color effect that exploits a gap between what&amp;rsquo;s physically happening, and what humans perceive. They&amp;rsquo;re often little optical illusions. Because of this, they aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be good, by any definition of &amp;ldquo;good.&amp;rdquo; They aren&amp;rsquo;t pretty, the colors aren&amp;rsquo;t harmonious, and any layout and shapes are arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did most of them in Procreate on my iPad. Albers recommends using colored paper rather than mixing oil paint because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get precise mixtures in paint, paper is less messy, and the focus stays on how you&amp;rsquo;re perceiving color rather than trying to get the right mixture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working digitally had these advantages, plus some that weren&amp;rsquo;t available in Albers&amp;rsquo; day, like measuring precise color values, blend modes, and adjusting hue/saturation/brightness after the fact. This was also a downside, though, because I sometimes got bogged down fiddling with the lightness and saturation of a color. A limited palette of colored paper would have prevented this. I did some of the later exercises with water-based markers, which were a good way of having a limited, but still expressive, palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you do these exercises, the iPad is a good way to go. Just aim for approximate colors that show the effect, and don&amp;rsquo;t spend too much time fiddling with the colors (or cheat with blending modes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="i-color-recollection"&gt;I — Color recollection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I ask you to imagine the color &amp;ldquo;red,&amp;rdquo; the color you see and the color I see will be different. Even if I ask you to imagine Coca-Cola red, we won&amp;rsquo;t see the same color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that peoples&amp;rsquo; ability to recall a specific color is hard (as compared to a specific flavor or sound, for example), and that there are no absolutes in color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ii-color-reading-and-contexture"&gt;II — Color reading and contexture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter says that the way we perceive color depends on context. &amp;ldquo;We almost never (that is, without special devices) see a single color unconnected and unrelated to other colors. Colors present themselves in continuous flux, constantly related to changing neighbors and changing conditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="iii-why-color-paper"&gt;III — Why color paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter Albers just explains why you should use colored paper. No exercise here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="iv-a-color-has-many-faces-the-relativity-of-color"&gt;IV — A color has many faces — the relativity of color&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter expands on the previous ones by explaining how our perception of color is further influenced by the colors we see before and after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albers uses an analogy of three buckets of water – warm, lukewarm, and cold — to demonstrate this. If you dip your hand in the warm water first, then the middle bucket, it will feel cold. But if you start with the cold bucket, the middle one will feel warm. This happens despite the fact that the physical temperature in the middle bucket is constant. Color is the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="v-lighter-and-or-darker-light-intensity-lightness"&gt;V — Lighter and/or darker — light intensity, lightness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise asks you to sort grays from lightest to darkest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this one since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have colored scraps of paper. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve done sorting exercises like these in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="vi-1-color-appears-as-2"&gt;VI — 1 color appears as 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first &amp;ldquo;Oh shit!&amp;rdquo; moment. All the talk of &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo; influencing color perception is made real here. He shows how one color can look like two. I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe my eyes when I first saw the effect. All the small blobs of color in the middle are the same. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me (and I didn&amp;rsquo;t when I first looked), &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/digital-color-meter/welcome/mac"&gt;you can measure them yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had fun with this one and made a ton of these. This isn&amp;rsquo;t even half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/2.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/3.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/4.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/5.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/6.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/7.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/8.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/9.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/10.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/11.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In this one I tried to achieve this effect just changing the hue, and keeping saturation and brightness constant. It was tough to do. It&amp;rsquo;s weaker than some other examples, but works overall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are two few free studies I did that explore different ways of exploiting this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/12.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VI/13.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="vii-2-different-colors-look-alike"&gt;VII — 2 different colors look alike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the opposite of the above exercise — make 2 colors look like 1. This one was hard. It took me a lot of trial and error to even get these solutions, which aren&amp;rsquo;t that pronounced. Even Albers says this effect sometimes just &amp;ldquo;pushes&amp;rdquo; colors closer together, rather than making them look &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same. But regardless of how strong the effect is, it will influence how people perceive colors you use, so you should be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VII/1.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The larger dots at top are different gray colors. The small dots in the middle corners are the grays used on the opposite side, which makes it clear how different they are from each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VII/2.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VII/3.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This uses the colors from above. The gray streaks look like they&amp;rsquo;re an even gray tone, but they&amp;rsquo;re not. They&amp;rsquo;re a gradient from the middle colors above. See below for the solid gradient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VII/4.png?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is the solid gradient of &amp;ldquo;gray&amp;rdquo; streaks above. Clearly not a flat gray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VII/5.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Not particularly effective, but close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/VII/6.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A free study using the colors above. I like the way it draws your eye around and different blues pop out at different places. There are only 4 colors in this image, but it looks like more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="viii-why-color-deception-after-image-simultaneous-contrast"&gt;VIII — Why color deception? After-image, simultaneous contrast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter isn&amp;rsquo;t an exercise, but demonstrates the effect of after-image. We all experience this when we look directly at a light for a few seconds, then look elsewhere, and the &amp;ldquo;after-image&amp;rdquo; of the light bulb follows you around, but in the opposite color (usually a blue-ish color since most light is yellow-ish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Albers, this is the &amp;ldquo;cause of most color illusions.&amp;rdquo; This exercise magnifies something that&amp;rsquo;s happening to us all the time, but usually in subtle ways we aren&amp;rsquo;t conscious of. The variables are the amount of time and quantity of the color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ix-color-mixture-in-paper-illusion-of-transparence"&gt;IX — Color mixture in paper — illusion of transparence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise challenges you to take two pieces of different colored paper, say blue and yellow, imagine the mixed color in your head, then find a piece of paper that matches this mixed color. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have colored paper, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this exercise, but chapter XI studies a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="x-factual-mixtures-additive-and-subtractive"&gt;X — Factual mixtures — additive and subtractive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors can be mixed with an additive or subtractive processes. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t an exercise, but rather an explanation of the effect, so I just used the blending modes in Procreate. The next exercise asks you to exploit this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Additive&amp;rdquo; refers to mixing color with light, which makes the resulting colors brighter (because there&amp;rsquo;s more light. &amp;ldquo;Screen&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Overlay&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Lighten&amp;rdquo; are blending modes you can use in your graphics program of choice or &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Subtractive&amp;rdquo; is mixing colors with pigment, as in painting and printing. This makes the resulting color darker (&amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Darken&amp;rdquo; are examples of this in graphics programs and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/X/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Subtractive color mixing, as with pigments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/X/2.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Additive color mixing, like mixing light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xi-transparence-and-space-illusion"&gt;XI — Transparence and space-illusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise asks you to choose colors so that where they overlap, one appears &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; the other, then &amp;ldquo;below&amp;rdquo; it, then the &amp;ldquo;middle mixture&amp;rdquo; where neither is above the other and they&amp;rsquo;re perfectly mixed (this is also the point at which the middle color looks like its own distinct color). This demonstrates the illusion of spatiality. Doing this successfully requires understanding the effects from the previous lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this one initially with water-based markers, since it&amp;rsquo;s easy to cheat in Procreate by just choosing blending modes. I wanted to see if I could achieve these effects using my eyes. I used Procreate for one (shown here first since the effect is easier to see), but chose colors by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test which color is &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; the other, or if you&amp;rsquo;ve found a true middle, Albers recommends running your eyes from left to right over the edges where the colors meet many times, then top to bottom, and vice versa. Which border has a &amp;ldquo;harder&amp;rdquo; edge? That color is more dominant, and thus perceived &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; the other one. To me this can feel like your eyes fall off a cliff, or hit a wall (depending on the direction you&amp;rsquo;re coming from).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Albers explains it: &amp;ldquo;Since softer boundaries disclose nearness implying connection, harder boundaries indicate distance, separation. [&amp;hellip;] Thus, with a middle mixture, all boundaries are equally soft or hard. As a consequence, a middle mixture appears frontal, as a color by itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XI/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In the top two streaks, blue feels above the yellow. In the bottom two, yellow feels above blue. Run your eyes over the edges to feel the &amp;ldquo;hardness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;softness&amp;rdquo; of the borders. There is no middle mixture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XI/2.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XI/3.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xii-optical-mixture-after-image-revised"&gt;XII — Optical mixture — after-image revised&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Optical mixture&amp;rdquo; means our eyes will mix two colors into a third. We all experience this daily without being aware of it. The printing process only uses 4 colors – Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK (aka CMYK), yet a full gamut of colors can be reproduced. How? The answer is because each color is printed in tiny dots (smaller than we can individually make out), and our eyes &amp;ldquo;mix&amp;rdquo; them into their final color. Cyan and magenta, for example, combine to make blue. These are also known as &amp;ldquo;halftones&amp;rdquo; in offset printing. If you look close enough at a newspaper or magazine you can see the individual dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pointillist painters also exploit this effect. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t paint green directly, for example, but instead use small dabs of blue and yellow and let the viewer&amp;rsquo;s eyes &amp;ldquo;mix&amp;rdquo; the colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can happen with larger blobs of color, too, if you&amp;rsquo;re far enough away. This once again demonstrates how size, quantity, and viewing distance influence the final perception of color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xiii-the-bezold-effect"&gt;XIII — The Bezold Effect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bezold was a rug maker who learned he could swap out one strong color (white for black, say) to change how the rest of the colors are perceived, thus making the rug &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; like a different design. This occurs due to a combination of optical mixture and after-image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIII/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The only difference from the left and right sides is the background. Notice how the left side feels lighter and calmer, whereas the right side feels heavier and more aggressive, like each rectangle is jumping out at you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xiv-color-intervals-and-transformation"&gt;XIV — Color intervals and transformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tough exercise. The goal is to take a collection of 4 colors, and &amp;ldquo;transcribe&amp;rdquo; them into a different &amp;ldquo;color key&amp;rdquo; of 4 different colors. In other words, the relationships, or &amp;ldquo;intervals,&amp;rdquo; between each color&amp;rsquo;s lightness and saturation are the same for both collections of colors. Just like transcribing a piece of music to another key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, this is trivial in Procreate or any graphics program. But I did it by eye to train how I see color. (Doing the transformation in Procreate does provide a useful way of &amp;ldquo;checking&amp;rdquo; your work, though, since it can be hard to know if you did it correctly until you&amp;rsquo;ve trained your eye).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the technique of running your eyes over the borders reveals the &amp;ldquo;hardness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;softness&amp;rdquo; of each, which can tell you if you maintained the &amp;ldquo;intervals&amp;rdquo; in the transcribed colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIV/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIV/2.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIV/3.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In this one it looks like I used Procreate&amp;rsquo;s HSB tool to rotate the hues around. But even this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take luminosity into effect, which is the measure of the perceived brightness of a color. For example, yellow appears brighter than blue, even at the same lightness and saturation levels. In this exercise, it makes the top-right blue color a salmon that&amp;rsquo;s more luminous than its source color, which makes its border &amp;ldquo;softer&amp;rdquo; than the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIV/4.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one, and the previous one, were the hardest of all because you have to transcribe four colors of different hues. Looking back at the solution above, it&amp;rsquo;s clear it&amp;rsquo;s not transcribed correctly. The intervals between the left two middle colors isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as the original, underlying colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIV/5.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xv-the-middle-mixture-again-intersecting-colors"&gt;XV — The middle mixture again — intersecting colors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albers has you do an activity to test if a color is the &amp;ldquo;middle mixture.&amp;rdquo; Get three colored papers of same hue but different lightness (you can also do this with overlapping rectangles in Figma or graphics program of choice — see picture below). Place the lightest one on the bottom, then the middle one partially overlapping that, and the darkest on top of that, showing just a sliver of the middle color. Slowly pull the top, darkest color to the right, revealing more of the middle color. Stare at the middle color while you do this, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a gradient from darkest, at left, to lightest, at right. If it&amp;rsquo;s even, it&amp;rsquo;s a middle mixture. This is also a result of our vision&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;after-image.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XV/2.png?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Start with the top setup, then slowly move the top color to the right to get to the bottom image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this middle color is truly in the middle, the gradient will appear even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also known as the &amp;ldquo;fluting&amp;rdquo; effect. It can make blocks of color appear to have gradients, or to be &amp;ldquo;concave&amp;rdquo; like doric columns. In the image below, stare at the middle color for awhile and you&amp;rsquo;ll start to perceive a gradient in each row. Or a &amp;ldquo;shadow&amp;rdquo; at bottom and &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo; at top. Once I started seeing this, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XV/1.png?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xvi-color-juxtaposition-harmony-quantity"&gt;XVI — Color juxtaposition — harmony — quantity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter was another &amp;ldquo;Oh shit!&amp;rdquo; moment. The goal is to use the same four colors, but make them &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; different, by varying the quantity and relative proportion of each. In my solution below, the four circles use the same four colors, but each feels different because of the varying quantities of each. &amp;ldquo;Quantity&amp;rdquo; here refers to both size and amount of repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albers makes an analogy with actors and performances. A cast of actors puts on performances, each of which will feel different depending on who is in the lead and supporting roles, despite it being the same actors throughout. Colors are the actors, and the way we use them are the performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVI/1.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sums up why all other methods of teaching color have fallen short for me. They talk about warm and cool tones, analogous and complementary and contrasting colors, but don&amp;rsquo;t recognize the impact of quantity and context. As Albers puts it: &amp;ldquo;Our conclusion: we may forget for a while those rules of thumb of complementaries, whether complete or &amp;lsquo;split&amp;rsquo;, and of triads and tetrads as well. They are worn out.&amp;rdquo; Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most palette generators and color inspiration sites overlook this, too. Once again, Albers expertly sums this up: &amp;ldquo;Usually, illustrations of harmonic color constellations which derive from authoritative systems look pleasant, beautiful, and thus convincing. But it should not be overlooked that they are usually presented in a most theoretical and least practicable manner, because normally all harmony members appear in the same quantity and the same shape, as well as in the same number (just once) and sometimes even in similar light intensity. Such outer equalizations may unify them, but at the expense of the more important inner relatedness — namely, as color only.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is full of great quotes, but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with just one more: &amp;ldquo;Good painting, good coloring, is comparable to good cooking. Even a good cooking recipe demands tasting and repeated tasting while it is being followed. And the best tasting still depends on a cook with taste.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xvii-film-color-and-volume-color-2-natural-effects"&gt;XVII — Film color and volume color — 2 natural effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing mountains in the distance, or an object through water, or putting semi-transparent acetate in front of something all diminish the colors of the underlying object. Distant mountains look more washed out, for example. No exercise here, just showing examples of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xviii-free-studies"&gt;XVIII — Free studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here to play with color, divorced from form and layout and anything else that influences its perception. This is, strictly speaking, impossible. But the point is to use color to produce a mood or effect on people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/1.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/2.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/3.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/4.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/5.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/6.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next three explore &amp;ldquo;old–young.&amp;rdquo; I was trying to juxtapose muted colors, to represent old (like faded newspapers), with lighter and brighter colors. I think they&amp;rsquo;re going the right direction, but not all the way there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/7.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/8.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/9.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These next two use a &amp;ldquo;magical&amp;rdquo; palette from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2zIOGnH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palette Perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Lauren Wager. This is a great book for color inspiration, and it gets bonus points for including the proportions in which you should use each color 🥳.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/10.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/11.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XVIII/12.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This final one makes use of a bunch of effects – the blue lines are factually the same color throughout but shift their &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; over each background (chapter IV, 1 color becomes 2), vanishing boundaries (below), and slight vibrating boundaries (also below).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xix-the-masters-color-instrumentation"&gt;XIX — The Masters — color instrumentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun one. In this exercise, we choose a painting and then recreate it using blocks of color (scraps of paper as written in the text). The point isn&amp;rsquo;t to recreate the masterpiece, but instead to engage with the color choices the artist made. &amp;ldquo;We try to give a general impression only as to climate, temperature, aroma, or sound of their work — not minute details.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point, as Albers puts it, is that it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;another means of learning to develop a sensitive and critical eye for color relatedness. [&amp;hellip;] Singing a tune and playing it on instruments — even more, conducting several instruments — provides more contact, more insight than merely hearing the tune. So cooking, normally and naturally, teaches more than reading recipes.&amp;rdquo; In other words, doing what the artist did forces you to engage with their work more deeply than just looking at it, even though it can feel like you&amp;rsquo;re just &amp;ldquo;copying&amp;rdquo; it. This is also the main point of Austin Kleon&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3aNbsHF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steal Like an Artist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIX/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIX/2.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XIX/3.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a fun drawing and coloring exercise I did using the palette from above. I like that it still &amp;ldquo;feels&amp;rdquo; like the original painting, even though it&amp;rsquo;s in a completely different form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xx-the-weber-fechner-law-the-measure-in-mixture"&gt;XX — The Weber-Fechner Law — the measure in mixture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effect demonstrates that to achieve a perceptually even gradation of saturation of color, you need to double the amount of pigment used at each step. This is more easily shown than described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left progression shows adding one more pen stroke at each step (as in, 1-2-3-4), whereas the right one doubles the pen strokes at each step (1-2-4-8). The left one doesn&amp;rsquo;t look equally more saturated throughout, and the last two steps especially look the same, despite the literal amount of pigment being doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XX/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xxi-from-color-temperature-to-humidity"&gt;XXI — From color temperature to humidity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that traditionally &amp;ldquo;warm&amp;rdquo; colors, like reds, oranges, and yellows, can also appear &amp;ldquo;cool.&amp;rdquo; And vice-versa for &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; colors, like blues, purples, and greens. This depends not only on their underlying hues, which can have warm or cool tones mixed in, but is also relative to the surrounding context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXI/1.jpeg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Some of these blues look warm, and some reds look cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xxii-vibrating-boundaries-enforced-contours"&gt;XXII — Vibrating boundaries — enforced contours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a coffee shop near my house that has a sign I can&amp;rsquo;t help but look at every time I walk by. It has a bright, saturated blue background with the name in bright, saturated red letters. I would sometimes perceive a slight border between the letters and background, but when I looked directly at it it would disappear. Are the letters slightly overprinted? Is there a subtle shadow or border there? Are my eyes just playing tricks on me? I could never quite figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I read this chapter. &amp;ldquo;A-ha!&amp;rdquo; I exclaimed. &amp;ldquo;I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t crazy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s happening is that contrasting, or near-contrasting, colors of similar saturation and brightness, when placed next to each other, will have a vibrating boundary. Sometimes it looks like reflected light, or a shadow, or a doubling or tripling of the border, or a separate border in a new hue. It happens in some conditions and not others, like natural light versus artificial, near or far focus, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a rare effect, and one that&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly hard to pin down. I often see it in my peripheral vision, but when I try to look directly at it it disappears, but then I&amp;rsquo;ll see it in another part of my peripheral vision, and on and on, pulling my eyes around and around. When it appears it&amp;rsquo;s usually somewhat unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/1.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was not so great. Doing it with pens was a mistake because the edges need to be precisely against each other, but my edges overlapped, mixing the pigments and ruining the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the ones below in Procreate and they&amp;rsquo;re much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/2.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/3.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/4.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/5.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/6.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXII/7.jpg?1588193631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xxiii-equal-light-intensity"&gt;XXIII — Equal light intensity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is the opposite of the previous one. Colors of similar hues, of similar light intensity, will have borders that disappear. It&amp;rsquo;s an even more difficult effect to achieve than the last chapter. Albers says very few painters can achieve it at all (it&amp;rsquo;s not so hard in Procreate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXIII/1.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Try looking off to the side, instead of directly at the image, and see if you can make out the jagged border between the two colors. For me, it disappears and the colors blend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2020-04-interaction-of-color/XXIII/2.jpg?1588193629" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xxiv-color-theories-color-systems"&gt;XXIV — Color theories — color systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the book, Albers gets to color theory. Only after experimenting with color and learning to see it, and all the tricks it plays on us, should we talk about underlying theories. As Albers says, &amp;ldquo;A sensitive eye for color became our first concern.&amp;rdquo; We must learn how to look at color, and to train our eyes. There are no absolutes in color. Therefore, using color theory without understanding this, and knowing all the ways colors can change depending on their context, is pointless. Even now color theory is of marginal usefulness, and trusting ones eyes is more important than following rules or the math of what a color &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; be or is &amp;ldquo;measured&amp;rdquo; to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much all Albers says on color theory. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk about contrasting colors, analogous, complementary, split complementary, etc., because it&amp;rsquo;s all relative. You need to learn to use your eyes and recognize the influence of quantity and context. As he says, &amp;ldquo;We emphasize that color harmonies, usually the special interest or aim of color systems, are not the only desirable relationship. As with tones in music, so with color–dissonance is as desirable as its opposite, consonance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="techniques-for-seeing-and-evaluating-color"&gt;Techniques for seeing and evaluating color&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book taught me some useful techniques for evaluating color. I included them in the relevant sections above, but I also collected them in a more general way here so they&amp;rsquo;re easy to refer back to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at colors out of the periphery of your eyes. Stare at a point off to the side, but focus your attention on the color (or area) in question. Does it pop out? Recede? Vibrate with its neighbors? And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at a middle point between two colors or areas to compare them simultaneously. Don&amp;rsquo;t look back and forth at them directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your eyes back and forth over edges to see which are &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; and which are &amp;ldquo;soft.&amp;rdquo; This tells you the color relationship between colors (which is darker or lighter, above or below, and so on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at work close up, and far away. Blur and squint your eyes. These reveal the overall gestalt of a piece. What colors pop out? Which recede? Which feel balanced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put two colors on top of each other (paper, rectangles on a screen, etc.). Stare at the overlapping area for longer than is comfortable (about 30 seconds or more). Then abruptly remove the top color, but keep staring at the covered area to look for an after-image. Do it again in the reverse order and look for an after-image. If they both have after-image (or no after-image), they&amp;rsquo;re about equal light intensity. If one has after-image but not the other, then the top color is darker. Do this multiple times to make sure the readings hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fin"&gt;Fin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, what a journey. Going through this again has really shown me how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come. I look at color completely differently now. I can remember designing UIs in the past, looking at a color (border, shadow, whatever) and thinking it looked &amp;ldquo;off,&amp;rdquo; and checking its hex value to see if it was the correct color (&amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; here meaning the hex I expected, or the same value we&amp;rsquo;ve used previously, or in our design system, or whatever). Turns out I should have learned to listen to my eyes more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a mistake I see in junior designers. Yes, a color might be what&amp;rsquo;s in our design system, but does it look good? Does it feel right? Learning taste and judgement is much harder, but infinitely more valuable. This lesson applies beyond just color — spacing, alignment, layout, size, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has also had a profound effect on me beyond just colors. Context is a key, yet overlooked, ingredient to a lot of parts of life. It influences flavors in cooking, sounds and notes in music, temperature, textures, smells, life experiences, how teams perform, how people behave, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2yU0mTQ"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; enough (and actually doing the exercises!) if you&amp;rsquo;re serious about color. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with one last Albers quote that sums this all up nicely: &amp;ldquo;Again: knowledge and its application is not our aim; instead, it is flexible imagination, discovery, invention – taste.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Designer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re working on a project and the team is aligned on the customer problem to be solved, the business value, and success criteria. The project has moved into the &lt;a href="/2016/07/17/discovery-kanban-at-optimizely/"&gt;solution exploration&lt;/a&gt; phase, and now the ball is firmly in your court. The whole team is looking to you to come up with a solution. A stroke of genius the likes of which the world has never seen! The success of this entire project rests on your shoulders. In the words of Ru Paul, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Y44nJh3ps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; fuck it up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling the pressure? I bet you are. Well I&amp;rsquo;m here to let you in on a little secret. Ready? Come closer so it&amp;rsquo;s just you and me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have all the answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to answer every question that comes up during the design process. A little known secret about design is that it&amp;rsquo;s a team sport. You&amp;rsquo;re going to face a million decision points along the way. Decisions that impact not only the user experience, but also the data model, backend and frontend architecture, customer adoption, project timelines, marketing messaging, sales demos, support docs, and more. Decisions that you can&amp;rsquo;t possibly have all the information or expertise to make alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t answering all of these questions, then what are you doing here? Why are you even on the team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t despair. Your role is to guide the team to the best answer, together. Draw out knowledge and ideas from all of your cross-functional peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take those ideas and give them form. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you came up with the idea or not. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t even matter if you &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the idea. Put your ego aside. You&amp;rsquo;re not a bad designer if someone else has a better idea than you. Make them all real as quickly and cheaply as possible. That may be &lt;a href="/2020/04/07/the-power-of-low-fidelity/"&gt;lo-fi mockups&lt;/a&gt;, written scenarios, flowcharts, clickthrough prototypes, boxes and arrows, or something else. The method you choose doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Just give them form, quickly and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last part is the true super-power of designers: &lt;em&gt;giving concrete form to abstract ideas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you talk about ideas in the abstract, everyone will have a different image in their head of what that is. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of room for misunderstanding and ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration of people in a meeting with different ideas in their heads of what's being discussed" src="/images/2020-04-dear-designer/team-misunderstanding.png?1586558068" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s describing one thing, but everyone is imagining something different. Illustrations from &lt;a href="http://www.fresh-folk.com"&gt;fresh-folk.com&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href="http://www.lenikauffman.com/"&gt;Leni Kauffman&lt;/a&gt;. Composition, speech and thought bubbles added by me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By giving concrete form to abstract ideas, you ensure everyone is talking about the same thing. The good, the bad, and the ugly is all laid bare. It shines a light on all the gaps in knowledge and assumptions that were lurking in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently in a team meeting where a designer presented the first round of &lt;a href="/2020/04/07/the-power-of-low-fidelity/"&gt;lo-fi work&lt;/a&gt; for a project. It was full of holes and open questions and unknowns. He certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t have all the answers. But he was open about gaps in his own knowledge and the questions this was raising for him. There were technical questions that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer on his own. Questions about the customer&amp;rsquo;s workflow that hadn&amp;rsquo;t surfaced. It highlighted that the team hadn&amp;rsquo;t even agreed on the conceptual model for how this feature should work yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laid it all out on the table. The group had a productive discussion about what was working, what wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, and open questions for each person to answer. At the end of the meeting, the lead engineer remarked, &amp;ldquo;It was very helpful to have something concrete to look at.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, designer, I&amp;rsquo;m here to tell you that we don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to have all the answers. We expect you to guide the team to the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now get out there and lead your teams to success! 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Jeff&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Power of Low-Fidelity</title>

&lt;p&gt;This was how our brand designer began his feedback to one of my product designers in design critique. The product designer presented early designs for a feature he was working on. Most importantly, his work was low-fidelity. It used simple black-and-white components and a casual, hand-written font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of a low-fidelity modal component" src="/images/2020-04-lo-fi/lo-fi-modal.png?1586286798" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;An example of a low-fidelity modal component. Not what the designer showed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His designs were still early, and subject to change. He needed feedback on high-level flows and interactions, not colors or fonts or spacing. Exploring those design details, and getting feedback on that, would have been a waste of time. The fidelity of his work matched the fidelity of his thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brand designer ended that statement with some general visual design advice for when he moves into high-fidelity. It took less than a minute. He didn&amp;rsquo;t rabbit-hole on a detailed, point-by-point critique of the entire design. How could he? There was no visual design. His feedback matched the fidelity of what was shown. The product designer got the feedback he needed, and the brand designer gave feedback that played to his strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That simple interaction demonstrated the power of showing low-fidelity work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I was exploring the &lt;a href="/2020/03/15/site-redesign-iii-typography/"&gt;world of typography&lt;/a&gt; to match my &lt;a href="/2020/01/27/site-redesign-i-the-guiding-concept/"&gt;guiding concept&lt;/a&gt;, I was also exploring ideas for the color, layout, and logo (some of which you saw in the &lt;a href="/2020/03/15/site-redesign-iii-typography/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;). I explored all 3 of these together because they were all interrelated. The placement of the logo and navigation dictated their color and style, so I was changing each variable simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My starting point was summer and beach — blue skies and water, warm sun, yellow sand, and so on. These ended up being both too cool-toned, and like I was getting fried on the beach under the bright mid-day sun. They were too literal. But hey, you have to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/1-blues.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of exploring blue skies and water, warm sun, and yellow sand." src="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/1-blues.png?1585533231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Exploring blue skies and water, warm sun, and yellow sand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched to a warmer palette, and using fat bands of solid color that I pulled from my mood board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/2-oranges.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of warmer palettes with fat bands of color." src="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/2-oranges.png?1585533231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Warmer palettes with fat bands of color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also tried out a &amp;ldquo;watercolored&amp;rdquo; (it was done in Procreate) header, and while the colors were nice, the aesthetic felt too artistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/3-watercolors.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of watercolor header." src="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/3-watercolors.png?1585533231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Watercolor header.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these were working as is, the colors were moving in the right direction. These explorations also helped me refine the aesthetic towards a 60s/70s California summer vibe (as described in the &lt;a href="/2020/02/10/site-redesign-ii-inspiration/"&gt;inspiration post&lt;/a&gt;). That pushed me to notice sunsets more. Specifically the time right when the sun is setting and the sky is a warm blue and the horizon is orange. That palette had just the right tones. The blues of my previous exploration were too bright and cool-toned, but this blue felt warm and comforting. And the orange paired with it perfectly (you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong taking inspiration from nature, y&amp;#39;all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/sunset-photos.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pictures of sunsets that inspired me" src="/images/2020-redesign/sunset-photos.png?1581401423" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pictures of sunsets that inspired me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too long after this (or maybe before, the timeline is impossible to keep track of) I saw the site design of &lt;a href="https://iheanyi.com/"&gt;Iheanyi Ekechukwu&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/julesforrest/status/1163185120456531968"&gt;Jules Forrest&amp;rsquo;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;. I combined his site layout with my sunset-inspired gradient, and violà! I had the basic frame for my site. I gave the content a warm, off-white background, and made the text a warm brown-ish orange, and the main content&amp;rsquo;s style snapped into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="navigation-logo"&gt;Navigation &amp;amp; Logo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was heavily influenced by &lt;a href="https://iheanyi.com/"&gt;Iheanyi Ekechukwu&amp;rsquo;s site&lt;/a&gt;, my navigation and logo were different from his, so I still needed to figure out where to place them, and how to style them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried them both inside and outside the main content area, in various blues, oranges, whites, and blacks. I didn&amp;rsquo;t fall in love with any option, and eventually settled on a temporary location of the navigation being dark blue and sitting above the main content while I tried out various type options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/5-nav-logo.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of logo and navigation above content." src="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/5-nav-logo.png?1585533231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Logo and navigation above content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also struggling with the JZ monogram. The hand drawn warmth of it still fit with the site&amp;rsquo;s new guiding light, but where do I put it? How do I style it? This took awhile to nail down. Like the navigation, I settled on the logo sitting above the content area in a light orange while I played with type (see image above), but that option never felt right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I set the type, I revisited these temporary decisions. I hit reset and started over with the design of Iheanyi Ekechuku&amp;rsquo;s site. The thinner outside gradient, combined with everything inside the white content area, felt cleaner, lighter, and put the emphasis on the content while having just enough color to make the site visually interesting and pull your eyes down the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the navigation dark blue so it would be of secondary importance to the content, and placed it in the top left corner, and that felt about right. At the last minute I switched it to a lighter brown color because I decided the blue was actually calling too much attention to itself. I must have done this in code because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it in Figma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was left with the logo, and let me tell you — this was a struggle. I converged on its placement pretty quickly (left side of the content, top-aligned with it), but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any color or style that fit with the guiding concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I churned out dozens of variations, of which a good 20 or so survived in Figma. I tried strokes, shadows, different colors and backgrounds, and more. I tried a bunch of tricks I learned from doing hand lettering, and was confident I had a style somewhere in my tool belt that would work. Alas, nothing stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/6-monograms1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of monogram variations." src="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/6-monograms1.png?1585533231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A subset of monogram variations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually hit a wall, so I sought out more inspiration. I scoured &lt;a href="https://www.fontsinuse.com"&gt;Fonts in Use&lt;/a&gt; posts, Google image searched for retro posters, and browsed 60s/70s lettering. I eventually found a hand-lettered style of big, chunky type that was duplicated and offset many times in different colors (inspiration that I apparently never saved anywhere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried that out and could tell I was in the right ballpark (see image below). I played around with the offest colors, sizes, and directions until landing on what you see today (see them all in my &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/808494599049531462/jlzych.com-site-explorations-2019"&gt;Figma Community file&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/7-monograms2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of monogram explorations in the right ballpark." src="/images/2020-redesign/color-layout/7-monograms2.png?1585533231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Monogram explorations in the right ballpark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the final result, although I find the colors a little too bright (especially in contexts off the site, like the favicon and Twitter), so I need to desaturate it and tweak the colors a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I did, mostly in code, was the link style. I knew I wanted a link style that didn&amp;rsquo;t call too much attention to itself, but at the same time they were an opportunity to give the text some visual flair. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what I tried, but when I saw the bright blue underline style, I knew that was it. I decided to make the underline &amp;ldquo;grow&amp;rdquo; on hover as a nice way to do something different and surprise readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, sums up my journey of how I redesigned this site. It took multiple years of off-and-on bursts of activity going back all the way to when I started adding hand lettering to the site, but the end result is a massive leap forward. I will continue tweaking it, but I&amp;rsquo;m confident the core aesthetic will serve me for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/808494599049531462/jlzych.com-site-explorations-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to see all the iterations and gory detail of how I got to the site as you see it today, I published my work on Figma Community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before I started &lt;a href="/2020/02/10/site-redesign-ii-inspiration/"&gt;moodboarding&lt;/a&gt;, or even found my &lt;a href="/2020/01/27/site-redesign-i-the-guiding-concept/"&gt;guiding concept&lt;/a&gt; (as documented in those previous two posts), I read &lt;a href="https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/designers-dictionary-of-type_9781419737183/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Designer&amp;rsquo;s Dictionary of Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and realized the typography on my site was not particularly warm or human. The fonts I had at the time were Myriad Black for headlines and interface copy (e.g. navigation), and Minion for body copy. (Before that I used Minion everywhere — even more boring). These fonts paired nicely together, and are well-made, but they&amp;rsquo;re too bland, corporate, and impersonal for a personal website. Once again, these decisions were made out of a desire to &amp;ldquo;not look bad.&amp;rdquo; They certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Designer&amp;rsquo;s Dictionary of Type&lt;/em&gt;, mixed with a couple years of &lt;a href="/scribbles"&gt;hand lettering&lt;/a&gt;, helped me see how all the small details and idiosyncracies of a typeface gave it personality. Before making a serious attempt to give my site a facelift (as documented here), I knew I wanted more human typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt, before I even had my guiding concept, was swapping Myriad for Gill Sans. Gill is similar to Myriad, but has unique letterforms for a sans, like the triangle-topped &amp;ldquo;t&amp;rdquo;. I tried it on, probably in code since I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it in Figma, and immediately discarded it. It looked fine, but overall my site still felt the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started keeping an eye out for more fonts to try and subscribed to &lt;a href="https://fontsinuse.com/"&gt;Fonts in Use&lt;/a&gt; to give me a steady stream of font inspiration. During this time I found my guiding concept and started gathering inspiration. I was being drawn to warm, friendly typefaces from the 60s and 70s, like Cooper Black. This melded with the &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; guiding light, and I realized this style of type would be a great way to express warmth and summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first tried on Cooper for size, since it&amp;rsquo;s the quintessential 70s font, and it (unsurprisingly) didn&amp;rsquo;t fit at all (screenshots below, which show various ideas I was workshopping). It felt too much like a novelty. Too flower power 🌸✌️☮︎ Also, Garfield. But I had to try it to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/typography/1-cooper.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Cooper Black as my headline font." src="/images/2020-redesign/typography/1-cooper.png?1584336919" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cooper Black as the headline font. What a goofball.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started casting about for another font in the spirit of Cooper. A font that has the round, soft serifs of Cooper, but is a little more serious. I scoured Adobe Fonts, Google Fonts, &lt;a href="https://www.typewolf.com/"&gt;Typewolf&lt;/a&gt;, and more, but didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything worth trying. I searched for &amp;ldquo;rounded serifs,&amp;rdquo; and browsed 60s and 70s type lists, all to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After cooling my search for a few months, Mackinac came to me via a &lt;a href="https://www.niceverynice.com/stories/font-pairings"&gt;Nice Very Nice font pairings article&lt;/a&gt; (which came to me from Sidebar). They featured Mackinac as used on &lt;a href="https://patternbrands.com/"&gt;Pattern Brands&amp;rsquo; site&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing it used there, it felt warm and friendly and inviting. I was excited to try it on, but when I did&amp;hellip; flop. It was a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; straight-laced. The edges of the serif were a bit too pointy. A little more rigid. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t as warm and inviting on my site as I was hoping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/typography/2-mackinac-pattern.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Mackinac as the headline font for Pattern Brands." src="/images/2020-redesign/typography/2-mackinac-pattern.jpeg?1584336920" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mackinac as the headline font for Pattern Brands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was back to square one, but this time not for long. &lt;a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/souvenir/"&gt;Souvenir&lt;/a&gt; came across my desk, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing via one of &lt;a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/28652/le-jardin-soupire"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; two &lt;a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/28687/emmanuelle-1974-u-s-movie-posters"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on Fonts in Use. That also led me to &lt;a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gastromond"&gt;Gastromond&lt;/a&gt;, probably by searching for similar typefaces (or maybe I was just browsing Adobe Fonts? Who knows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/typography/3-souvenir-gastromond.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Souvenir and Gastromond type specimens." src="/images/2020-redesign/typography/3-souvenir-gastromond.png?1584336919" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Souvenir on top, Gastromond on the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Souvenir, I loved the warmth and friendliness that came from its soft edges and nice wide, round letterforms. The &amp;ldquo;e&amp;rdquo; has a great laid back vibe that I love. The lowercase &amp;ldquo;v&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;y&amp;rdquo;, uppercase &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;, and a few other letters have a little bit of bowing to them that make them feel relaxed and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Gastromond, its off-axis counterforms make it feel like it&amp;rsquo;s leaning back and relaxed. I also loved the contrast between the thick and thin strokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried them both on, and Souvenir was the clear winner. It was warm, friendly, a little funky and retro, all without feeling goofy or like a novelty font. It retained just enough seriousness to not undermine the generally serious tone of my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gastromond was a little too pointy, and not as warm as I was hoping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/typography/4-gastro-souvenir.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Gastromond and Souvenir on an early exploration of my site." src="/images/2020-redesign/typography/4-gastro-souvenir.png?1584336919" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Headlines set as Gastromond on the left, and Souvenir on the right, using an early design exploration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with Souvenir Bold to really lean into its personality. It borders on chunky at times, but the Medium weight felt too timid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only complaint about Souvenir is the kerning is sometimes off. At times letters run into each other (like around the lowercase &amp;ldquo;i&amp;quot;s), and other times my eyes trip over the space between letters (like between &amp;quot;v&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;o&amp;rdquo;). The kerning of the numbers is also too wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="body-copy"&gt;Body Copy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having finally found a headline font, I was on to the next challenge: body copy. The headline took a long time to find, but I was at least chasing a muse, and knew it when I saw it. But I had no idea what to do with the body copy. What pairs with a warm 70s serif? Another serif? A sans-serif? Blackletter? Souvenir is often used in signs, storefronts, posters, and record covers — not editorials. I had no idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Souvenir is a serif, my first move was to pair it with a sans serif. Classic pairing. But I was never too keen on this idea because my site is a blog, and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly longform content, so I prefer serifs for their ease of reading and the editorial tone they imbue the text with. I want the content to be taken seriously, so the typeface should reflect that, but still have some warmth to it to match the headline font. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be overly literary or stuffy or newspaper-y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first tried some wider sans, including Proxima Nova and Open Sans. But they were still sans, so the reading experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, and overall they just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right. Even so, Open Sans wasn&amp;rsquo;t awful, so I kept it in my back pocket for awhile and used it in Figma while trying out different layouts and colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/typography/5-opensans-proxima.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of body copy set in Open Sans and Proxima Nova." src="/images/2020-redesign/typography/5-opensans-proxima.png?1584336919" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Body copy set in Open Sans on the left, Proxima Nova on the right, in another early exploration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I moved on to some classic serifs, like Times New Roman and Caslon and Georgia, but they felt too stuffy. I liked Georgia the best so far, and it was my leading choice for quite a while. It also had the advantage of being free and preinstalled on everyone&amp;rsquo;s devices, thus fast to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2020-redesign/typography/6-georgia-caslon.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of body copy set as Georgia and Caslon." src="/images/2020-redesign/typography/6-georgia-caslon.png?1584336919" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Body copy set as Georgia on the left, Caslon on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I liked Georgia and Open Sans, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; them the way I loved Souvenir. I knew I had to keep pushing to find something better. I asked myself, what is it that&amp;rsquo;s working about those fonts? The characteristics that gelled with Souvenir were their wide, round, open letterforms, and tall x-heights. Open Sans also had a softness about it that came from a lack of serifs. Nothing that could poke your eye out. These characteristics paired well with Souvenir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led me to search for a serif that was round, open, tall x-height, but friendlier and softer and a little lighter than Georgia. Once again, I trawled Adobe Fonts, Google Fonts, Fonts in Use, Typewolf, and more. Searching for a font to meet those requirements was tough — there weren&amp;rsquo;t filters for the specific attributes I was looking for. I just browsed long lists of serifs for body copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Adobe Fonts I eventually came across &lt;a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/mrs-eaves-xl"&gt;Mrs Eaves XL&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modern revival of the classic Mrs Eaves, but made for setting &amp;ldquo;long readerly texts.&amp;rdquo; It has round, open letter forms, was easy to read at body copy sizes, and was warmer, more human, and lighter than Georgia. It also has &lt;em&gt;beautiful italics&lt;/em&gt; (especially the &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;v&amp;rdquo;). I tried it out in Figma and 🙌.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="interface-text"&gt;Interface text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was the question of what to do with interface copy. Specifically, the navigation and links to Twitter after each post. You may remember from the beginning of this post (which was ages ago in real-time), I tried out Gill Sans. I also tried Gill Sans Black, which is basically its own distinct typeface, and super unique. Neither worked as headlines, but the fun quirkiness of Gill Sans Black stayed with me. On a lark, I ended up setting the navigation links to that in Figma while messing around with other fonts, layouts, and colors, with the assumption that I would change it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, I never had any other serious contenders. I tried out some other sans serif options, like Verdana, Myriad, and regular Gill Sans, but none of them were doing it for me. After seeing Gill Sans Black in there over and over again it grew on me. When I saw it set alongside Souvenir and Mrs Eaves XL, it worked in a funky, unexplainable way. Certainly not a conventional choice, but I loved how opinionated its personality was, and how that makes it stand out so distinctly from the rest of the type on the site. It clearly signals to visitors that this text is different from everything else you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="type-scale"&gt;Type Scale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 6 months later, I finally had my fonts. The final piece of the puzzle was defining my type scale. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly rigorous about this process. No fancy math or ratios to calculate my type sizes, leading, and margins. Instead, I started with some rough sizing in Figma, and then iterated in code so I could make adjustments with real content until it looked right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My starting point from Figma was too large, so I cut down my headlines across the board. I started with the H4, which is the deepest I go, setting it just large enough to stand out from the copy (easy to do since the typefaces are so different). Then I set the H1 large and in charge to communicate its importance, and lean into its personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For H2 and H3, I chose some sizes between H1 and H4. These are always the toughest for me to set because they&amp;rsquo;re the in the middle. Is it too big? Too small? I dunno 🤷‍♂️ I try to make sure they&amp;rsquo;re just different enough to be distinct, that when I scroll through the page they set pieces of text apart from each other, when squinting they still stand out as headlines, and that when all 4 are next to each other they have a clear hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also looked at the spacing between headlines and paragraphs, cutting down the margins between some elements so that the page had a smooth rhythm while scrolling. In other words, no gaps for your eyes to trip over. While going through this process, Frank Chimero &lt;a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/gardening-vs-architecture/"&gt;blogged about his process for this&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me get to my final design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="game-set-match"&gt;Game, Set, Match.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the better part of a year later, my typography was set. You can check out a fraction of my explorations in the screenshot below, or check out my &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/808494599049531462/jlzych.com-site-explorations-2019"&gt;published Figma file&lt;/a&gt; to browse everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A fraction of my type explorations (and visual design ideas) in Figma.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy process, and the road was far from straight, but in the end I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the site layout and color palette.&lt;/p&gt;
