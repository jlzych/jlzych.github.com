    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I learned that writing helps clarify my thoughts. It makes me much more articulate. It forces me to engage with a topic and wrestle it to the ground so that I understand it much more deeply than I did when I started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that writing is hard. But like design and code and tennis, it‚Äôs a skill that can be practiced and learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that blogging consistently is hard. Coming up with ideas and pushing them out into the world takes work, and takes practice to form into a habit. I learned that I‚Äôd rather focus on quality and writing about what I think is interesting, even if that means I don‚Äôt publish as often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that even when I have a lot of ideas to write about, not all of them are worth working on. I‚Äôm okay with letting ideas go rather than trying to force myself to work on them. I‚Äôve learned this is a good litmus test for knowing what‚Äôs worth spending my time on. The most interesting topics will naturally drive me to work on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that it‚Äôs just as much work, often more, to promote your writing, as it is to do the writing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like writing, I learned that dating takes a lot of time and energy (even when it‚Äôs online). I learned that I can‚Äôt put in that time and energy unless I‚Äôm attracted (both mentally and physically) to a woman. I can‚Äôt force it. I learned that even with online dating, or because of it, it will take a lot of dates before finding someone who feels ‚Äúright.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that most single people of my generation, both men and women, are frustrated to some degree by dating. Online dating has made it easier than ever to meet people, but the increase in quantity has not increased the quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that an abundance of choice ‚Äî in products to buy, shows to watch, people to date, articles and books to read, etc. ‚Äî increases the pressure of making the ‚Äúright‚Äù choice. There‚Äôs always a nagging question of, ‚ÄúIs there something better?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also learned that perfect is the enemy of done. There is no perfect. I need to continue practicing making a decision and moving on, without stressing about whether or not it was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù choice. There will always be a better choice, despite my best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned I enjoy management, more than I expected. Including the people management part (career development, promotions/raises, etc.). I learned transparency, candor, and empathy go a long way towards quelling people‚Äôs anxieties, especially amongst organizational change. And especially when delivering ‚Äúbad‚Äù news, or giving critical feedback. This is as true for personal relationships as it is work relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that providing context, the ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù behind a decision is more important than the decision itself. It helps people understand it, and accept it, even if they don‚Äôt agree with it. And it engenders trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I don‚Äôt miss designing and coding much since becoming a manager. The bits and pieces I get to do here and there, in and out of work, is usually enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that just telling someone a lesson you‚Äôve learned through experience is not likely to change their thoughts or behavior. Experience is the best teacher. This can be painful when you see someone making a mistake you could have prevented, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to accept this. (This is a good lesson to know if I ever have kids üë™ ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I learned that giving people information in an effort to increase their knowledge, or change their behavior, isn‚Äôt the most effective way of achieving this goal. It‚Äôs much more effective, albeit harder, to ask questions that lead a person to ‚Äúearn‚Äù this knowledge themselves. By getting someone to come to their own conclusions, they‚Äôre more likely to internalize and act on that new knowledge. And they can apply the framework for gaining that knowledge to new situations. This is an art as much as it is a skill, and takes practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that product development is hard, even when a person‚Äôs been doing it for a long time. Especially with teams, and as a company grows. I learned that as clueless as I might feel about how to run a team or build products, no one seems to have it completely figured out (even if they‚Äôre experienced and, from the outside, seem to know what they‚Äôre doing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I like having physical books over eBooks. I display them on my shelves, which makes me much more likely to re-engage with a book after I‚Äôve finished reading it. By seeing it, I‚Äôll think about it more, and pick it up and flip through it. I don‚Äôt do this when a book is trapped in software. The same is generally true with music and movies, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that underlining passages in books helps me focus on the core ideas being communicated, helps me stay engaged, helps me retain the information better, and makes it easy for me to flip through a book later and remember the key parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that everything I spend time on has an opportunity cost. So I&amp;rsquo;m learning to get comfortable focusing on the things I most enjoy (such as writing), and accepting the cost of not doing other things (such as playing guitar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that with sustained effort over time I could be good at almost anything (art, music, programming, sports, etc.). But as my &amp;ldquo;opportunity cost&amp;rdquo; lesson indicates, I can‚Äôt be good at everything. I have to choose what to spend time on, and thus what to be good at. And with enough effort, perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll even become great at something. üòÑ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I learned that I can&amp;rsquo;t possibly document everything I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in a year. There were too many lessons, big and small. Here&amp;rsquo;s looking forward to another year of learning in 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Designers Should Code</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, AT&amp;amp;T commissioned Matthew Carter to design a typeface for their phone book. They wanted a typeface that could fit more characters per line without a loss of legibility, especially at smaller sizes. This would save them money by reducing the number of pages needed to print the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter knew that phone books are printed on cheap newsprint paper that doesn‚Äôt produce high-quality text. He also understood that ink spreads when applied to this cheap paper, especially at smaller sizes, which decreases legibility. All of this posed significant challenges for creating a legible typeface for AT&amp;amp;T‚Äôs phone book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of giving up in desperation, Carter embraced these constraints and designed for them. The resulting typeface, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Centennial"&gt;Bell Centennial&lt;/a&gt;, maintains legibility by having a tall x-height and large, open bowls. His true masterstroke, however, was designing &amp;ldquo;ink traps‚Äù into the letterforms. Ink traps are small notches in the letter that anticipate the spread of ink on newsprint. When the ink is pressed onto paper, the ink spreads into these traps. The result is a filled in letter that‚Äôs easy to read, even at small sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Closeup of Bell Centennial" src="/images/2015-12-10-why-designers-should-code/bell-centennial.png?1449765651" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closeup of Bell Centennial by Matthew Carter. Source: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Centennial"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter embraced the constraints of the medium and turned them to his advantage. His deep understanding of the printing process allowed him to make this leap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like print, the web is a medium with its own constraints. We often forget they‚Äôre there, but they are. To display a web page, a browser must download, parse, and render HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This code imposes limits on what web pages can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best designers understand these constraints, and design for them. To gain this understanding, you must know how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this comes with a caveat: designers shouldn‚Äôt write production code. They&amp;rsquo;re experts in the user experience, not frontend technology. They should be solving customer problems, not trying to write scalable, maintainable, and performant code. That&amp;rsquo;s a full-time job that requires &lt;a href="https://medium.com/design-optimizely/why-we-hire-ui-engineers-on-optimizely-s-design-team-b2a789553b79#.qiwr5ezia"&gt;dedicated professionals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So learn how to code. Ink traps don‚Äôt design themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 12/12/15: This article sparked a lot of questions about designers not writing production code on &lt;a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/60579"&gt;Designer News&lt;/a&gt;. I responded to a lot of them and attempted to clarify what I meant by that statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In summary, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to draw a hard and fast line on what designers should do, or what they&amp;rsquo;re capable of doing skill-wise. Writing production code on occasion is fine. But what I have a problem with is if designers are expected to code everything they design. Those are separate jobs that should be handled by separate people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After jamming with a friend, she commented that she felt emotionally spent afterwards. Not quite sure what she meant, I asked her to elaborate. She said that improvising music makes you feel vulnerable. You‚Äôve got to put yourself out there, which opens you up to judgement and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she‚Äôs right. In that moment I realized that being a designer trained me to get over that fear. I know I have to start somewhere shitty before I can get somewhere good. Putting myself and my ideas out there is part of that process. My work only becomes good through feedback and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my advice to you, young designer, is to accept the fact that before your work becomes great, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be shitty. This will be hard at first. You&amp;rsquo;ll feel vulnerable. You‚Äôll fear judgement. You‚Äôll worry about losing the respect of your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But get over it&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve all felt this way before. Just remember that we&amp;rsquo;re all in this together. We all want to produce great work for our customers. We all want to make great music together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get comfortable sharing your shitty work. You‚Äôll start off discordant, but through the process of iteration and refinement you‚Äôll eventually hit your groove.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‚ÄúDid You A/B Test It?‚Äù</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After launching a feature, coworkers often ask me, &amp;ldquo;Did you A/B test it?&amp;rdquo; While the question is well-meaning, A/B testing isn‚Äôt the only way, or even the best way, of making data-informed decisions in product development. In this post, I‚Äôll explain why, and provide other ways of validating hypotheses to assure your coworkers that a feature was worth building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implied-development-process"&gt;Implied Development Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coworker‚Äôs simple question implies a development process that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an idea for a new feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You build the new feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You A/B test it to prove its success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit! High fives! Release party!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this looks reasonable on the surface, it has a few flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="flaw-1-what-metric-are-you-measuring"&gt;Flaw 1: What metric are you measuring?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A/B test in step 3 implies that you‚Äôre comparing a version of the product with the new feature to a version without the new feature. But a key part of running an A/B test is choosing a metric to call the winner, which is where things get tricky. Your instinct is probably to measure usage of the new feature. But this doesn‚Äôt work because the control lacks the feature, so it loses before the test even begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, higher-level metrics you care about. These could range from broad business metrics, like revenue or time in product, to more narrow metrics, like completing a specific task (such as successfully booking a place to stay in the case of AirBnB). Generally speaking, broader metrics are slower to move and influenced by more factors, so narrow metrics are better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, this type of experiment isn‚Äôt what A/B tests excels at. At its core, &lt;a href="https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/"&gt;A/B testing&lt;/a&gt; is a hill climbing technique. This means it‚Äôs good at telling you if small, incremental changes are an improvement (in other words, each test is a step up a hill). Launching a feature is more like exploring a new hill. You‚Äôre giving users the ability to do something they couldn‚Äôt do before. A/B testing isn‚Äôt good at comparing hills to each other, nor will it help you find new hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="flaw-2-what-if-the-new-feature-loses"&gt;Flaw 2: What if the new feature loses?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs say you have good metrics to measure, and enough traffic to run the test in a reasonable timeframe. But the results come back, and the unthinkable happened: your new feature lost. There‚Äôs no profit, high fives, or launch party. Now what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of sunk costs, your instinct is going to be to try to improve the feature until it wins. But an A/B test doesn‚Äôt tell you &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it lost. Maybe there was a minor usability problem, or maybe it‚Äôs fundamentally flawed. Whatever the problem may be, an A/B test won‚Äôt tell you what it is, which doesn‚Äôt help you improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst-case scenario is that the feature doesn‚Äôt solve a real problem, in which case you should remove it. But this is an expensive option because you spent the time to design, build, and launch it &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; learning it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth building. Ideally you‚Äôd discover this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="revised-development-process"&gt;Revised Development Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our well-meaning coworker asked if we A/B tested the new feature, what they really wanted to know is if we have data to back up that it was worth building. To them, an A/B test is the only way they know how to answer that question. But as user experience professionals, we know there are plenty of methods for gathering data to guide our designs. Let‚Äôs revise our product development process from above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an idea for a new feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You scope the problem the feature is supposed to solve by interviewing users, sending out surveys, analyzing product usage, or using other research methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create prototypes and show them to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You refine the design based on user feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You repeat steps 3 and 4 until you‚Äôre confident the design solves the problem you set out to solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You build the feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do user testing to find and fix usability flaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You release the feature via a phased rollout (or a private/public/opt-in beta) and measure your key metrics to make sure they‚Äôre within normal parameters.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be run as an A/B test, but doesn‚Äôt need to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you‚Äôre confident the feature is working as expected, fully launch it to everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit! High fives! Release party!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize the feature by A/B testing incremental changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this revised development process (commonly called &lt;a href="http://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html"&gt;user-centered design&lt;/a&gt;), you‚Äôre gathering data every step of the way. Rather than building a feature and &amp;ldquo;validating&amp;rdquo; it at the end with an A/B test, you‚Äôre continually refining what you‚Äôre building based on user feedback. By the time you release it, you‚Äôve iterated countless times and are confident it‚Äôs solving a real problem. And once it‚Äôs built, you can use A/B testing to do what A/B testing does best ‚Äî optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longer process? Yes. A more confident, higher quality launch? Also yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when your coworkers ask if you A/B tested your feature, you can reply, &amp;ldquo;No, but we made data-informed decisions that told us users really want this feature. Let me show you all of our data!&amp;rdquo; By using research and A/B testing appropriately, you‚Äôll build features that your users &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your bottom line will love.&lt;/p&gt;
